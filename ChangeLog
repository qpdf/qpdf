2011-08-11  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* include/qpdf/qpdf-c.h ("C"): add new methods qpdf_get_info_key
	and qpdf_set_info_key for manipulating text fields of the /Info
	dictionary.

2011-08-10  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* libqpdf/QPDFWriter.cc (copyEncryptionParameters): preserve
	whether metadata is encryption.  This fixes part of bug 3173659:
	the password becomes invalid if qpdf copies an encrypted file with
	cleartext-metadata.

	* include/qpdf/QPDFWriter.hh: add a new constructor that takes
	only a QPDF reference and leaves specification of output for
	later.  Add methods setOutputFilename() to set the output to a
	filename or stdout, and setOutputMemory() to indicate that output
	should go to a memory buffer.  Add method getBuffer() to retrieve
	the buffer used if output was saved to a memory buffer.

	* include/qpdf/QPDF.hh: add methods replaceObject() and
	swapObjects() to allow replacement of an object and swapping of
	two objects by object ID.

	* include/qpdf/QPDFObjectHandle.hh: add new methods getDictAsMap()
	and getArrayAsVector() for returning the elements of a dictionary
	or an array as a map or vector.

2011-06-25  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* 2.2.4: release

2011-06-23  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* make/libtool.mk (install): Do not strip executables and shared
	libraries during installation.  Leave that up to the packager.

	* configure.ac: disable -Werror by default.

2011-05-07  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* libqpdf/QPDF_linearization.cc (isLinearized): remove unused
	offset variable, found by a gcc 4.6 warning.

2011-04-30  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* 2.2.3: release

	* libqpdf/QPDF.cc (readObjectInternal): Accept the case of the
	stream keyword being followed by carriage return by itself.  While
	this is not permitted by the specification, there are PDF files
	that do this, and other readers can read them.

	* libqpdf/Pl_QPDFTokenizer.cc (processChar): When an inline image
	is detected, suspend normalization only up to the end of the
	inline image rather than for the remainder of the content stream.
	(Fixes qpdf-Bugs 3152169.)

2011-01-31  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* libqpdf/QPDF.cc (readObjectAtOffset): use -1 rather than 0 when
	reading an object at a given to indicate that no object number is
	expected.  This allows xref recovery to proceed even if a file
	uses the invalid object number 0 as a regular object.

	* libqpdf/QPDF_linearization.cc (isLinearized): use -1 rather than
	0 as a sentintel for not having found the first object in the
	file.  Since -1 can never match the regular expression, this
	prevents an infinite loop when checking a file that starts with
	(erroneous) 0 0 obj.  (Fixes qpdf-Bugs-3159950.)

2010-10-04  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* 2.2.2: release

	* include/qpdf/qpdf-c.h: Add qpdf_read_memory to C API to call
	QPDF::processMemoryFile.

2010-10-01  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* 2.2.1: release

	* include/qpdf/QPDF.hh: Add setOutputStreams method to allow
	redirection of library-generated output/error to alternative
	streams.

	* include/qpdf/QPDF.hh: Add processMemoryFile method for
	processing a PDF file from a memory buffer instead of a file.

2010-09-24  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* libqpdf/QPDF.cc: change private "file" method to be a
	PointerHolder<InputSource> to prepare qpdf for being able to work
	with PDF files loaded into memory in addition to working with
	files on disk.

	* include/qpdf/PointerHolder.hh: add operator* and operator->
	methods so that PointerHolder objects can be used like pointers.
	This is consistent with the smart pointer objects in the next
	revision of C++.

2010-09-05  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* libqpdf/QPDF.cc (readObjectInternal): Recognize empty objects
	and treat them as null.

	* libqpdf/QPDF_Stream.cc (filterable): Handle inline image filter
	abbreviations as stream filter abbreviations.  Although this is
	not technically allowed by the PDF specification, table H.1 in the
	pre-ISO spec indicates that Adobe's readers accept them.  Thanks
	to Jian Ma <stronghorse@tom.com> for bringing this to my
	attention.

2010-08-14  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* 2.2.0: release

	* Rename README.windows to README-windows.txt and convert its line
	endings to Windows-style line endings.  Also mention Jian Ma's VC6
	port in the manual and README-windows.txt.

2010-08-09  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* Add QPDFObjectHandle::getRawStreamData to return raw
	(unfiltered) stream data.

2010-08-08  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* 2.2.rc1: release

2010-08-05  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* Add QPDFObjectHandle::addPageContents, a convenience routine for
	appending or prepending new streams to a page's content streams.
	The "pdf-double-page-size" example illustrates its use.

	* Add new methods to QPDFObjectHandle: replaceStreamData and
	newStream.  These methods allow users of the qpdf library to add
	new streams and to replace data of existing streams.  The
	"pdf-double-page-size" and "pdf-invert-images" examples illustrate
	their use.

2010-06-06  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* Fix memory leak for QPDF objects whose underlying PDF objects
	contain circular references.  Thanks to Jian Ma
	<stronghorse@tom.com> for calling my attention to the memory leak.

2010-04-25  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* 2.1.5: release

	* libqpdf/QPDF_encryption.cc (compute_encryption_key): remove
	restrictions on length of file identifier string.  (Fixes
	qpdf-Bugs-2991412.)

2010-04-18  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* 2.1.4: release

	* libqpdf/QPDFWriter.cc (writeLinearized): the padding calculation
	fix in 2.1.2 was applied in only one place but it was needed in
	two places since there are actually two cross reference streams in
	a linearized file.  The new padding calculation is now used for
	both streams.  Hopefully this should put an end to linearization
	padding problems.  (Fixes qpdf-Bugs-2979219.)

2010-04-10  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* qpdf/qpdf.cc (main): Since qpdf --check only checks syntax and
	stream encoding without doing any semantic checks, make the output
	clearer when no errors around found.  This is inspired by
	qpdf-Bugs-2983225.

2010-03-27  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* 2.1.3: release

	* libqpdf/QPDF_optimization.cc (flattenScalarReferences): Flatten
	scalar references for unreferenced objects as well as those seen
	during traversal of the file.  This matters when preserving object
	streams that contain unreferenced objects with indirect scalars.
	(Fixes qpdf-Bugs-2974522.)  Updated TODO with a description of a
	possibly better fix involving removal of flattenScalarReferences.

	* libqpdf/Pl_AES_PDF.cc (finish): Don't complain if an AES input
	buffer is not a multiple of 16 bytes.  Instead, just pad with
	nulls and hope for the best.  PDF files have been encountered "in
	the wild" that contain AES buffers that aren't a multiple of 16
	bytes.

2010-01-24  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* 2.1.2: release

	* libqpdf/QPDFWriter.cc: fix logic error in padding calculation.
	When writing linearized files with cross reference streams, the
	padding calculation failed to take differences in sizes of
	compressed data between pass 1 and pass 2 into consideration.

2009-12-14  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* 2.1.1: release

	* qpdf/qtest/qpdf.test: improve test for acroread to make sure it
	actually works and is not just present in the path.

2009-12-13  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* libqpdf/qpdf/Pl_AES_PDF.hh: include <stdint.h>, if available, so
	we have valid definitions of uint32_t.

2009-10-30  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* 2.1: release

	* libqpdf/QPDF.cc: be more forgiving of extraneous whitespace in
	the xref table and while recovering from error conditions.

2009-10-26  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* Work around failure of PCRE test case; this test case exercises
	an aspect of PCRE that qpdf does not use, and the test fails with
	the version of PCRE on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, so we ignore
	failure on this particular test case.

	* Fix RPM .spec file to include "C" examples

2009-10-24  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* 2.1.rc1: release

	* Provide interfaces for getting qpdf's own version number

2009-10-19  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* include/qpdf/QPDF.hh (QPDF): getWarnings now returns a list of
	QPDFExc rather than a list of strings.  This way, warnings may be
	inspected in more detail.

	* Include information about the last object read in most error
	messages.  Most of the time, this will provide a good hint as to
	which object contains the error, but it's possible that the last
	object read may not necessarily be the one that has the error if
	the erroneous object was previously read and cached.

2009-10-18  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* If forcing version, disable object stream creation and/or
	encryption if previous specifications are incompatible with new
	version.  It is still possible that PDF content, compression
	schemes, etc., may be incompatible with the new version, but at
	least this way, older viewers will at least have a chance.

	* libqpdf/QPDFWriter.cc (unparseObject): avoid compressing
	Metadata streams if possible.

2009-10-13  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* Upgrade embedded qtest to version 1.4, which allows the test
	suite to be run in Windows with MSYS and ActiveState Perl rather
	than requiring Cygwin perl.

2009-10-04  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* Implement support AES encrypt and crypt filters.  Implementation
	is not fully tested due to lack of test data but has been tested
	for several cases.

2009-10-04  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* Add methods to QPDFWriter and corresponding command line
	arguments to qpdf to set the minimum output PDF version and also
	to force the version to a particular value.

	* libqpdf/QPDF.cc (processXRefStream): warn and ignore extra xref
	stream entries when stream is larger than reported size.  This
	used to be a fatal error.  (Fixes qpdf-Bugs-2872265.)

2009-09-27  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* Add several methods to query permissions controlled by the
	encryption dictionary.  Note that qpdf does not enforce these
	permissions even though it allows the user to query them.

	* The function QPDF::getUserPassword returned the user password
	with the required padding as specified by the PDF specification.
	This is seldom useful to users.  This function has been replaced
	by QPDF::getPaddedUserPassword.  Call the new
	QPDF::getTrimmedUserPassword to retreive the user password in a
	human-readable format.

	* qpdf/qpdf.cc (main): qpdf --check now prints the PDF version
	number in addition to its other output.

2009-09-26  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* Removed all references to QEXC; now using std::runtime_error and
	std::logic_error and their subclasses for all exceptions.

2009-05-03  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* 2.0.6: release

	* libqpdf/QPDF_Stream.cc (filterable): ignore /DecodeParms if it's
	not a type we recognize.  (Fixes qpdf-Bugs-2779746.)

2009-03-10  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* 2.0.5: release

2009-03-09  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* libqpdf/Pl_LZWDecoder.cc: adjust LZWDecoder full table
	detection, now having been able to adequately test boundary
	conditions both and with and without early code change.  Also
	compared implementation with other LZW decoders.

2009-03-08  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* qpdf/fix-qdf (write_ostream): Adjust offsets while writing
	object streams to account for changes in the length of the
	dictionary and offset tables.

	* qpdf/qpdf.cc (main): In check mode, in addition to checking
	structure of file, attempt to decode all stream data.

	* libqpdf/QPDFWriter.cc (QPDFWriter::writeObject): In QDF mode,
	write a comment to the QDF file before each object that indicates
	the object ID of the corresponding object from the original file.
	Add --no-original-object-ids flag to qpdf and
	setSuppressOriginalObjectIDs() method to QPDFWriter to turn this
	behavior off.

	* libqpdf/QPDF.cc (QPDF::pipeStreamData): Issue a warning instead
	of failing if there is a problem found while decoding stream.

	* qpdf/qpdf.cc: Exit with a status of 3 if warnings were found
	regardless of what mode we're in.

2009-02-21  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* 2.0.4: release

2009-02-20  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* Fix many typos in comments and strings.

	* qpdf/qpdf.cc: in --check mode, if there are warnings but no
	errors, exit with a status of 3.

	* libqpdf/QPDF.cc (QPDF::insertXrefEntry): when recovering the
	cross-reference table, have objects we encounter later in the file
	supersede those we found earlier.  This improves the chances of
	being able to recover appended files with damaged cross-reference
	tables.

2009-02-19  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* libqpdf/Pl_LZWDecoder.cc: correct logic error for previously
	untested case of running the LZW decoder without the "early code
	change" flag.  Thanks to a bug report from "Atom Smasher", I
	finally was able to obtain an input stream compressed in this way.

2009-02-15  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* 2.0.3: release

2008-12-11  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* qpdf/qpdf.cc (main): Accept -help and -version as well as --help
	and --version

2008-11-23  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* Include stdio.h in a few files for proper compilation with (yet
	to be released) gcc 4.4

	* updated embedded qtest to version 1.3

	* libqpdf/QPDF_String.cc (QPDF_String::getUTF8Val): handle
	UTF-16BE properly rather than just treating the string as a string
	of 16-bit characters.

2008-06-30  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* 2.0.2: release

	* updated embedded qtest to version 1.2 (includes previous
	changes)

2008-06-07  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* qpdf/qtest/qpdf/diff-encrypted: change == to = so that the test
	suite passes when /bin/sh is not bash

2008-05-07  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* qtest/bin/qtest-driver (run_test): increase timeout for qtest to
	be more tolerant of slow machines

2008-05-06  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* 2.0.1: release

	* make/rules.mk: fix logic with .dep generation for .lo files so
	that dependencies work properly with libtool

2008-05-05  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* libqpdf/qpdf/MD5.hh: fix header to be 64-bit clean

	* configure.ac: add tests for sized integer types

2008-05-04  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* libqpdf/QPDF_encryption.cc: do not assume size_t is unsigned int

	* qpdf/qtest/qpdf.test: removed locale-specific tests.  These were
	really to check bugs in perl 5.8.0 and are obsolete now.  They
	also make the test suite fail in some environments that don't have
	all the locales fully configured.

	* various: updated several files for gcc 4.3 by adding missing
	includes (string.h, stdlib.h)

2008-04-26  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* 2.0: initial public release
