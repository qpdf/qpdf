2.1
===

 * Update documentation to reflect new command line flags and any
   other relevant changes.  Should read through ChangeLog and the
   manual before releasing 2.1.

 * Update release documentation to remember not to include debugging
   in the Windows release and to strip the DLL and executables.
   Consider making the "install" target do something useful for
   Windows.  Update README.windows in this case including taking out
   the mention of strip since it should be handled by the install
   step.  Determine whether -g with strip is different from not -g
   with strip.  Make sure release includes building for both
   compilers.

 * Add comments for the security functions that map them back to the
   items in Adobe's products.

 * "Delphi wrapper unit 'qpdf.pas' created by Zarko Gajic
   (http://delphi.about.com). .. use at your own risk and for whatever
   the purpose you want .. no support provided. Sample code provided."


2.2
===

 * Add ability to create new streams or replace stream data.  Consider
   stream data sources to include a file and offset, a buffer, or a
   some kind of callback mechanism.  Find messages exchanged with
   Stefan Heinsen <stefan.heinsen@gmx.de> in August, 2009.  He seems
   to like to send encrypted mail.  (key 01FCC336)

 * Look at page splitting.


General
=======

 * Handle embedded files.  PDF Reference 1.7 section 3.10, "File
   Specifications", discusses this.  Once we can definitely recongize
   all embedded files in a docucment, we can update the encryption
   code to handle it properly.  In QPDF_encryption.cc, search for
   cf_file.  Remove exception thrown if cf_file is different from
   cf_stream, and write code in the stream decryption section to use
   cf_file instead of cf_stream.  In general, add interfaces to
   get the list of embedded files and to extract them.  To handle
   general embedded files associated with the whole document, follow
   root -> /Names -> /EmbeddedFiles -> /Names to get to the file
   specification dictionaries.  Then, in each file specification
   dictionary, follow /EF -> /F to the actual stream.

 * The description of Crypt filters is unclear with respect to how to
   use them to override /StmF for specific streams.  I'm not sure
   whether qpdf will do the right thing for any specific individual
   streams that might have crypt filters.  The specification seems to
   imply that only embedded file streams and metadata streams can have
   crypt filters, and there are already special cases in the code to
   handle those.  Most likely, it won't be a problem, but someday
   someone may find a file that qpdf doesn't work on because of crypt
   filters.  There is an example in the spec of using a crypt filter
   on a metadata stream.

   For now, we notice /Crypt filters and decode parameters consistent
   with the example in the PDF specification, and the right thing
   happens for metadata filters that happen to be uncompressed or
   otherwise compressed in a way we can filter.  This should handle
   all normal cases, but it's more or less just a guess since I don't
   have any test files that actually use stream-specific crypt filters
   in them.

 * The second xref stream for linearized files has to be padded only
   because we need file_size as computed in pass 1 to be accurate.  If
   we were not allowing writing to a pipe, we could seek back to the
   beginning and fill in the value of /L in the linearization
   dictionary as an optimization to alleviate the need for this
   padding.  Doing so would require us to pad the /L value
   individually and also to save the file descriptor and determine
   whether it's seekable.  This is probably not worth bothering with.

 * The whole xref handling code in the QPDF object allows the same
   object with more than one generation to coexist, but a lot of logic
   assumes this isn't the case.  Anything that creates mappings only
   with the object number and not the generation is this way,
   including most of the interaction between QPDFWriter and QPDF.  If
   we wanted to allow the same object with more than one generation to
   coexist, which I'm not sure is allowed, we could fix this by
   changing xref_table.  Alternatively, we could detect and disallow
   that case.  In fact, it appears that Adobe reader and other PDF
   viewing software silently ignores objects of this type, so this is
   probably not a big deal.

 * Pl_PNGFilter is only partially implemented.  If we ever decoded
   images, we'd have to finish implementing it along with the other
   filter decode parameters and types.  For just handling xref
   streams, there's really no need as it wouldn't make sense to use
   any kind of predictor other than 12 (PNG UP filter).

 * If we ever want to have check mode check the integrity of the free
   list, this can be done by looking at the code from prior to the
   object stream support of 4/5/2008.  It's in an if (0) block and
   there's a comment about it.  There's also something about it in
   qpdf.test -- search for "free table".  On the other hand, the value
   of doing this seems very low since no viewer seems to care, so it's
   probably not worth it.

 * QPDFObjectHandle::getPageImages() doesn't notice images in
   inherited resource dictionaries.  See comments in that function.

 * Based on an idea suggested by user "Atom Smasher", consider
   providing some mechanism to recover earlier versions of a file
   embedded prior to appended sections.

Splitting by Pages
==================

Although qpdf does not currently support splitting a file into pages,
the work done for linearization covers almost all the work.  To do
page splitting.  If this functionality is needed, study
obj_user_to_objects and object_to_obj_users created in
QPDF_optimization for ideas.  It's quite possible that the information
computed by calculateLinearizationData is actually sufficient to do
page splitting in many circumstances.  That code knows which objects
are used by which pages, though it doesn't do anything page-specific
with outlines, thumbnails, page labels, or anything else.

Another approach would be to traverse only pages that are being output
taking care not to traverse into the pages tree, and then to fabricate
a new pages tree.

Either way, care must be taken to handle other things such as
outlines, page labels, thumbnails, threads, zones, etc. in a sensible
way.  This may include simply omitting information other than page
content.
