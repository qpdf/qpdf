Fuzz Errors
===========

* https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=<N>

* To fix:
  * 19253 - indirect leaks. Not sure of the cause, but it might have
    something to do with multiple instances of the same object being
    read and discarded during file recovery. Maybe there's a missing
    call to releaseResolved.

* Ignoring these:
  * Problems inside the jpeg library: 15470, 15751, 18633, 18732,
    18745, 20391
  * Timeout: 15471, 17630

ABI Changes
===========

This is a list of changes to make next time there is an ABI change.
Comments appear in the code prefixed by "ABI"

* (Source compatibility) As somewhat discussed in issue 219, the
  original pipeStreamData in QPDF_Stream has various logic for
  reporting warnings and letting the caller retry. This logic is not
  implemented for stream data providers. When copying foreign streams,
  qpdf uses a stream data provider (QPDF::CopiedStreamDataProvider) to
  read the stream data from the original file. While a warning is
  issued for that case, there is no way to actually propagate failure
  information back through because
  StreamDataProvider::provideStreamData doesn't take the
  suppress_warnings or will_retry options, and adding them would break
  source compatibility.

C++-11
======

* Search for ::iterator and ::const_iterator and replace with either
  auto or foreach-style iteration.

* There may be some places where std::function and lambdas can
  simplify handlers rather than using classes with apply methods.

* My c++11 branch adds re-implements PointerHolder so that it is
  interchangeable with std::shared_ptr. We may not actually want to
  ever do this because it turns out PointerHolder is slightly more
  performant than std::shared_ptr, at least as of g++ 9.2.1. It is not
  actually possible to just replace PointerHolder with std::shared_ptr
  for two reasons: there is no automatic creation of
  std::shared_ptr<T> from T* like there is for PointerHolder, which
  breaks some code, and also there is no automatic conversion from
  something like std::vector<PointerHolder<T>> to
  std::vector<std::shared_ptr<T>>. It may be a good idea to replace
  PointerHolder with std::shared_ptr in the API even if it requires
  some work for the developer, but even if that isn't worth it, we
  should find all occurrences of PointerHolder within the code and
  replace with std::shared_ptr or std::unique_ptr as needed. This will
  definitely break binary compatibility as the PointerHolder<Members>
  pattern is part of the ABI for almost every class.


Page splitting/merging
======================

 * Update page splitting and merging to handle document-level
   constructs with page impact such as interactive forms and article
   threading. Check keys in the document catalog for others, such as
   outlines, page labels, thumbnails, and zones. For threads,
   Subramanyam provided a test file; see ../misc/article-threads.pdf.
   Email Q-Count: 431864 from 2009-11-03.

 * bookmarks (outlines) 12.3.3
   * support bookmarks when merging
   * prune bookmarks that don't point to a surviving page when merging
     or splitting
   * make sure conflicting named destinations work possibly test by
     including the same file by two paths in a merge
   * see also comments in issue 343

   Note: original implementation of bookmark preservation for split
   pages caused a very high performance hit. The problem was
   introduced in 313ba081265f69ac9a0324f9fe87087c72918191 and reverted
   in the commit that adds this paragraph. The revert includes marking
   a few tests cases as $td->EXPECT_FAILURE. When properly coded, the
   test cases will need to be adjusted to only include the parts of
   the outlines that are actually copied. The tests in question are
   "split page with outlines". When implementing properly, ensure that
   the performance is not adversely affected by timing split-pages on
   a large file with complex outlines such as the PDF specification.

   When pruning outlines, keep all outlines in the hierarchy that are
   above an outline for a page we care about. If one of the ancestor
   outlines points to a non-existent page, clear its dest. If an
   outline does not have any children that point to pages in the
   document, just omit it.

   Possible strategy:
   * resolve all named destinations to explicit destinations
   * concatenate top-level outlines
   * prune outlines whose dests don't point to a valid page
   * recompute all /Count fields

   Test files
   * page-labels-and-outlines.pdf: old file with both page labels and
     outlines. All destinations are explicit destinations. Each page
     has Potato and a number. All titles are feline names.
   * outlines-with-actions.pdf: mixture of explicit destinations,
     named destinations, goto actions with explicit destinations, and
     goto actions with named destinations; uses /Dests key in names
     dictionary. Each page has Salad and a number. All titles are
     silly words. One destination is an indirect object.
   * outlines-with-old-root-dests.pdf: like outlines-with-actions
     except it uses the PDF-1.1 /Dests dictionary for named
     destinations, and each page has Soup and a number. Also pages are
     numbered with upper-case Roman numerals starting with 0. All
     titles are silly words preceded by a bullet.

   If outline handling is significantly improved, see
   ../misc/bad-outlines/bad-outlines.pdf and email:
   https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/rfc822msgid%3A02aa01d3d013%249f766990%24de633cb0%24%40mono.hr)

 * Form fields: should be similar to outlines.

MSVC Wildcard Expansion
=======================

(This section is referenced in azure_pipelines.yml.)

The qpdf executable built with msvc is linked with setargv.obj or
wsetargv.obj so that wildcard expansion works. It doesn't work exactly
the way a UNIX system would work in that the program itself does the
expansion (rather than the shell), which means that invoking qpdf.exe
as built by msvc will expand "*.pdf" just as it will expand *.pdf. In
some earlier versions, wildcard expansion didn't work with the msvc
executable. The way to make this work appears to be different in some
versions of MSVC than in others. As such, if upgrading MSVC or
changing the build environment, the wildcard expansion behavior of the
qpdf executable in Windows should be retested manually.

Unfortunately, there is no automated test for wildcard expansion with
MSVC because I can't figure out how to prevent qtest from expanding
the wildcards before passing them in, and explicitly running "cmd /c
..." from qtest doesn't seem to work in Azure Pipelines, though I can
make it work locally.

Ideally, we should figure out a way to test this in CI by having a
test that fails if wildcard expansion is broken. In the absence of
this, it will be necessary to test the behavior manually in both mingw
and msvc when run from cmd and from msys bash.

Performance
===========

As described in https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf/issues/401, there was
great performance degradation between qpdf 7.1.1 and 9.1.1. Doing a
bisect between dac65a21fb4fa5f871e31c314280b75adde89a6c and
release-qpdf-7.1.1, I found several commits that damaged performance.
I fixed some of them to improve performance by about 70% (as measured
by saying that old times were 170% of new times). The remaining
commits that broke performance either can't be correct because they
would re-introduce an old bug or aren't worth correcting because of
the high value they offer relative to a relatively low penalty. For
historical reference, here are the commits. The numbers are the time
in seconds on the machine I happened to be using of splitting the
first 100 pages of PDF32000_2008.pdf 20 times and taking an average
duration.

Commits that broke performance:

* d0e99f195a987c483bbb6c5449cf39bee34e08a1 -- object description and
  context: 0.39 -> 0.45
* a01359189b32c60c2d55b039f7aefd6c3ce0ebde (minus 313ba08) -- fix
  dangling references: 0.55 -> 0.6
* e5f504b6c5dc34337cc0b316b4a7b1fca7e614b1 -- sparse array: 0.6 -> 0.62

Other intermediate steps that were previously fixed:

* 313ba081265f69ac9a0324f9fe87087c72918191 -- copy outlines into
  split: 0.55 -> 4.0
* a01359189b32c60c2d55b039f7aefd6c3ce0ebde -- fix dangling references:
  4.0 -> 9.0

This commit fixed the awful problem introduced in 313ba081:

* a5a016cdd26a8e5c99e5f019bc30d1bdf6c050a2 -- revert outline
  preservation: 9.0 -> 0.6

Note that the fix dangling references commit had a much worse impact
prior to removing the outline preservation, so I also measured its
impact in isolation.

A few important lessons:

* Indirection through PointerHolder<Members> is expensive, and should
  not be used for things that are created and destroyed frequently
  such as QPDFObjectHandle and QPDFObject.
* Traversal of objects is expensive and should be avoided where
  possible.

Future ideas:

* Look at places in the code where object traversal is being done and,
  where possible, try to avoid it entirely or at least avoid ever
  traversing the same objects multiple times.
* Avoid attaching too much metadata to objects and object handles
  since those have to get copied around a lot.

Also, it turns out that PointerHolder is more performant than
std::shared_ptr.


General
=======

NOTE: Some items in this list refer to files in my personal home
directory or that are otherwise not publicly accessible. This includes
things sent to me by email that are specifically not public. Even so,
I find it useful to make reference to them in this list

 * Add support for writing name and number trees

 * Figure out how to render Gajić correctly in the PDF version of the
   qpdf manual.

 * Consider creating a PPA for Ubuntu

 * Investigate whether there is a way to automate the memory checker
   tests for Windows.

 * Support user-pluggable stream filters.  This would enable external
   code to provide interpretation for filters that are missing from
   qpdf.  Make it possible for user-provided filters to override
   built-in filters.  Make sure that the pluggable filters can be
   prioritized so that we can poll all registered filters to see
   whether they are capable of filtering a particular stream.

 * If possible, consider adding CCITT3, CCITT4, or any other easy
   filters. For some reference code that we probably can't use but may
   be handy anyway, see
   http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/ps/sdk/index_archive.html

 * If possible, support the following types of broken files:

    - Files that have no whitespace token after "endobj" such that
      endobj collides with the start of the next object

    - See ../misc/broken-files

 * Additional form features
   * set value from CLI? Specify title, and provide way to
     disambiguate, probably by giving objgen of field

 * replace mode: --replace-object, --replace-stream-raw,
   --replace-stream-filtered
   * update first paragraph of QPDF JSON in the manual to mention this
   * object numbers are not preserved by write, so object ID lookup
     has to be done separately for each invocation
   * you don't have to specify length for streams
   * you only have to specify filtering for streams if providing raw data

 * Pl_TIFFPredictor is pretty slow.

 * Support for handling file names with Unicode characters in Windows
   is incomplete. qpdf seems to support them okay from a functionality
   standpoint, and the right thing happens if you pass in UTF-8
   encoded filenames to QPDF library routines in Windows (they are
   converted internally to wchar_t*), but file names are encoded in
   UTF-8 on output, which doesn't produce nice error messages or
   output on Windows in some cases.

 * If we ever wanted to do anything more with character encoding, see
   ../misc/character-encoding/, which includes machine-readable dump
   of table D.2 in the ISO-32000 PDF spec. This shows the mapping
   between Unicode, StandardEncoding, WinAnsiEncoding,
   MacRomanEncoding, and PDFDocEncoding.

 * Some test cases on bad files fail because qpdf is unable to find
   the root dictionary when it fails to read the trailer. Recovery
   could find the root dictionary and even the info dictionary in
   other ways. In particular, issue-202.pdf can be opened by evince,
   and there's no real reason that qpdf couldn't be made to be able to
   recover that file as well.

 * Audit every place where qpdf allocates memory to see whether there
   are cases where malicious inputs could cause qpdf to attempt to
   grab very large amounts of memory. Certainly there are cases like
   this, such as if a very highly compressed, very large image stream
   is requested in a buffer. Hopefully normal input to output
   filtering doesn't ever try to do this. QPDFWriter should be checked
   carefully too. See also bugs/private/from-email-663916/

 * Interactive form modification:
   https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf/issues/213 contains a good discussion
   of some ideas for adding methods to modify annotations and form
   fields if we want to make it easier to support modifications to
   interactive forms. Some of the ideas have been implemented, and
   some of the probably never will be implemented, but it's worth a
   read if there is an intention to work on this. In the issue, search
   for "Regarding write functionality", and read that comment and the
   responses to it.

 * Look at ~/Q/pdf-collection/forms-from-appian/

 * Consider adding "uninstall" target to makefile. It should only
   uninstall what it installed, which means that you must run
   uninstall from the version you ran install with. It would only be
   supported for the toolchains that support the install target
   (libtool).

 * Provide support in QPDFWriter for writing incremental updates.
   Provide support in qpdf for preserving incremental updates.  The
   goal should be that QDF mode should be fully functional for files
   with incremental updates including fix_qdf.

   Note that there's nothing that says an indirect object in one
   update can't refer to an object that doesn't appear until a later
   update.  This means that QPDF has to treat indirect null objects
   differently from how it does now.  QPDF drops indirect null objects
   that appear as members of arrays or dictionaries.  For arrays, it's
   handled in QPDFWriter where we make indirect nulls direct.  This is
   in a single if block, and nothing else in the code cares about it.
   We could just remove that if block and not break anything except a
   few test cases that exercise the current behavior.  For
   dictionaries, it's more complicated.  In this case,
   QPDF_Dictionary::getKeys() ignores all keys with null values, and
   hasKey() returns false for keys that have null values.  We would
   probably want to make QPDF_Dictionary able to handle the special
   case of keys that are indirect nulls and basically never have it
   drop any keys that are indirect objects.

   If we make a change to have qpdf preserve indirect references to
   null objects, we have to note this in ChangeLog and in the release
   notes since this will change output files.  We did this before when
   we stopped flattening scalar references, so this is probably not a
   big deal.  We also have to make sure that the testing for this
   handles non-trivial cases of the targets of indirect nulls being
   replaced by real objects in an update.  I'm not sure how this plays
   with linearization, if at all.  For cases where incremental updates
   are not being preserved as incremental updates and where the data
   is being folded in (as is always the case with qpdf now), none of
   this should make any difference in the actual semantics of the
   files.

 * When decrypting files with /R=6, hash_V5 is called more than once
   with the same inputs.  Caching the results or refactoring to reduce
   the number of identical calls could improve performance for
   workloads that involve processing large numbers of small files.

 * Consider adding a method to balance the pages tree.  It would call
   pushInheritedAttributesToPage, construct a pages tree from scratch,
   and replace the /Pages key of the root dictionary with the new
   tree.

 * Secure random number generation could be made more efficient by
   using a local static to ensure a single random device or crypt
   provider as long as this can be done in a thread-safe fashion.  In
   the initial implementation, this is being skipped to avoid having
   to add any dependencies on threading libraries.

 * Study what's required to support savable forms that can be saved by
   Adobe Reader. Does this require actually signing the document with
   an Adobe private key? Search for "Digital signatures" in the PDF
   spec, and look at ~/Q/pdf-collection/form-with-full-save.pdf, which
   came from Adobe's example site. See also
   ../misc/digital-sign-from-trueroad/. If digital signatures are
   implemented, update the docs on crypto providers, which mention
   that this may happen in the future.

 * See if we can avoid preserving unreferenced objects in object
   streams even when preserving the object streams.

 * Provide APIs for embedded files.  See *attachments*.pdf in test
   suite.  The private method findAttachmentStreams finds at least
   cases for modern versions of Adobe Reader (>= 1.7, maybe earlier).
   PDF Reference 1.7 section 3.10, "File Specifications", discusses
   this.

   A sourceforge user asks if qpdf can handle extracting and embedded
   resources and references these tools, which may be useful as a
   reference.

   http://multivalent.sourceforge.net/Tools/pdf/Extract.html
   http://multivalent.sourceforge.net/Tools/pdf/Embed.html

 * The description of Crypt filters is unclear with respect to how to
   use them to override /StmF for specific streams.  I'm not sure
   whether qpdf will do the right thing for any specific individual
   streams that might have crypt filters, but I believe it does based
   on my testing of a limited subset.  The specification seems to imply
   that only embedded file streams and metadata streams can have crypt
   filters, and there are already special cases in the code to handle
   those.  Most likely, it won't be a problem, but someday someone may
   find a file that qpdf doesn't work on because of crypt filters.
   There is an example in the spec of using a crypt filter on a
   metadata stream.

   For now, we notice /Crypt filters and decode parameters consistent
   with the example in the PDF specification, and the right thing
   happens for metadata filters that happen to be uncompressed or
   otherwise compressed in a way we can filter.  This should handle
   all normal cases, but it's more or less just a guess since I don't
   have any test files that actually use stream-specific crypt filters
   in them.

 * The second xref stream for linearized files has to be padded only
   because we need file_size as computed in pass 1 to be accurate.  If
   we were not allowing writing to a pipe, we could seek back to the
   beginning and fill in the value of /L in the linearization
   dictionary as an optimization to alleviate the need for this
   padding.  Doing so would require us to pad the /L value
   individually and also to save the file descriptor and determine
   whether it's seekable.  This is probably not worth bothering with.

 * The whole xref handling code in the QPDF object allows the same
   object with more than one generation to coexist, but a lot of logic
   assumes this isn't the case.  Anything that creates mappings only
   with the object number and not the generation is this way,
   including most of the interaction between QPDFWriter and QPDF.  If
   we wanted to allow the same object with more than one generation to
   coexist, which I'm not sure is allowed, we could fix this by
   changing xref_table.  Alternatively, we could detect and disallow
   that case.  In fact, it appears that Adobe reader and other PDF
   viewing software silently ignores objects of this type, so this is
   probably not a big deal.

 * Based on an idea suggested by user "Atom Smasher", consider
   providing some mechanism to recover earlier versions of a file
   embedded prior to appended sections.

 * From a suggestion in bug 3152169, consider having an option to
   re-encode inline images with an ASCII encoding.

 * From github issue 2, provide more in-depth output for examining
   hint stream contents. Consider adding on option to provide a
   human-readable dump of linearization hint tables. This should
   include improving the 'overflow reading bit stream' message as
   reported in issue #2. There are multiple calls to stopOnError in
   the linearization checking code. Ideally, these should not
   terminate checking. It would require re-acquiring an understanding
   of all that code to make the checks more robust. In particular,
   it's hard to look at the code and quickly determine what is a true
   logic error and what could happen because of malformed user input.
   See also ../misc/linearization-errors.

 * If I ever decide to make appearance stream-generation aware of
   fonts or font metrics, see email from Tobias with Message-ID
   <5C3C9C6C.8000102@thax.hardliners.org> dated 2019-01-14.

 * Consider creating a sanitizer to make it easier for people to send
   broken files. Now that we have json mode, this is probably no
   longer worth doing. Here is the previous idea, possibly implemented
   by making it possible to run the lexer (tokenizer) over a whole
   file. Make it possible to replace all strings in a file lexically
   even on badly broken files. Ideally this should work files that are
   lacking xref, have broken links, etc., and ideally it should work
   with encrypted files if possible. This should go through the
   streams and strings and replace them with fixed or random
   characters, preferably, but not necessarily, in a manner that works
   with fonts. One possibility would be to detect whether a string
   contains characters with normal encoding, and if so, use 0x41. If
   the string uses character maps, use 0x01. The output should
   otherwise be unrelated to the input. This could be built after the
   filtering and tokenizer rewrite and should be done in a manner that
   takes advantage of the other lexical features. This sanitizer
   should also clear metadata and replace images.
