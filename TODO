 * Take changes on encryption-keys branch and make them usable.
   Replace the hex encoding and decoding piece, and come up with a
   more robust way of specifying the key.

 * Consider whether there should be a mode in which QPDFObjectHandle
   returns nulls for operations on the wrong type instead of asserting
   the type. The way things are wired up now, this would have to be a
   global flag. Probably it makes sense to make that be the default
   behavior and to add a static method in QPDFObjectHandle and
   command-line flag that enables the stricter behavior globally for
   easier debugging. For cases where we have enough information to do
   so, we could still warn when not in strict mode.

 * Add method to push inheritable resources to a single page by
   walking up and copying without overwrite.  Above logic will also be
   sufficient to fix the limitation in
   QPDFObjectHandle::getPageImages().  Maybe add a method to get the
   effective resources for a page without modifying the page and then
   implement both changes in terms of that method.

 * Support user-pluggable stream filters.  This would enable external
   code to provide interpretation for filters that are missing from
   qpdf.  Make it possible for user-provided filters to override
   built-in filters.  Make sure that the pluggable filters can be
   prioritized so that we can poll all registered filters to see
   whether they are capable of filtering a particular stream.

 * If possible, consider adding CCITT3, CCITT4, or any other easy
   filters. For some reference code that we probably can't use but may
   be handy anyway, see
   http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/ps/sdk/index_archive.html

 * If possible, support the following types of broken files:

    - Files that have no whitespace token after "endobj" such that
      endobj collides with the start of the next object

    - See ../misc/broken-files


Lexical
=======

Consider rewriting the tokenizer. These are rough ideas at this point.
I may or may not do this as described.

 * Use flex. Generate them from ./autogen.sh and include them in the
   source package, but do not commit them.

 * Make it possible to run the lexer (tokenizer) over a while file
   such that the following things would be possible:

   * Rewrite fix-qdf in C++ so that there is no longer a runtime perl
     dependency

   * Create a way to filter content streams that could be used to
     preserve the content stream exactly including spaces but also to
     do things like replace everything between a detected set of
     markers. This is to support form flattening. Ideally, it should
     be possible to use this programmatically on broken files.

   * Make it possible to replace all strings in a file lexically even
     on badly broken files. Ideally this should work files that are
     lacking xref, have broken links, etc., and ideally it should work
     with encrypted files if possible. This should go through the
     streams and strings and replace them with fixed or random
     characters, preferably, but not necessarily, in a manner that
     works with fonts. One possibility would be to detect whether a
     string contains characters with normal encoding, and if so, use
     0x41. If the string uses character maps, use 0x01. The output
     should otherwise be unrelated to the input. This could be built
     after the filtering and tokenizer rewrite and should be done in a
     manner that takes advantage of the other lexical features. This
     sanitizer should also clear metadata and replace images.

General
=======

NOTE: Some items in this list refer to files in my personal home
directory or that are otherwise not publicly accessible. This includes
things sent to me by email that are specifically not public. Even so,
I find it useful to make reference to them in this list

 * Audit every place where qpdf allocates memory to see whether there
   are cases where malicious inputs could cause qpdf to attempt to
   grab very large amounts of memory. Certainly there are cases like
   this, such as if a very highly compressed, very large image stream
   is requested in a buffer. Hopefully normal input to output
   filtering doesn't ever try to do this. QPDFWriter should be checked
   carefully too. See also bugs/private/from-email-663916/

 * Form flattening: ~/tmp/qtmp/form-flattening-email/. Distill this
   into notes along with stuff in qpdf email box.

 * Look at ~/Q/pdf-collection/forms-from-appian/

 * Look at Travis-CI for qpdf. See email from Travis-CI in pending.

 * Consider adding "uninstall" target to makefile. It should only
   uninstall what it installed, which means that you must run
   uninstall from the version you ran install with. It would only be
   supported for the toolchains that support the install target
   (libtool).

 * Figure out how to find Visual Studio in Windows registry and see if
   I can get it to work with make so I can simplify creation of
   Windows releases.

 * Provide support in QPDFWriter for writing incremental updates.
   Provide support in qpdf for preserving incremental updates.  The
   goal should be that QDF mode should be fully functional for files
   with incremental updates including fix_qdf.

   Note that there's nothing that says an indirect object in one
   update can't refer to an object that doesn't appear until a later
   update.  This means that QPDF has to treat indirect null objects
   differently from how it does now.  QPDF drops indirect null objects
   that appear as members of arrays or dictionaries.  For arrays, it's
   handled in QPDFWriter where we make indirect nulls direct.  This is
   in a single if block, and nothing else in the code cares about it.
   We could just remove that if block and not break anything except a
   few test cases that exercise the current behavior.  For
   dictionaries, it's more complicated.  In this case,
   QPDF_Dictionary::getKeys() ignores all keys with null values, and
   hasKey() returns false for keys that have null values.  We would
   probably want to make QPDF_Dictionary able to handle the special
   case of keys that are indirect nulls and basically never have it
   drop any keys that are indirect objects.

   If we make a change to have qpdf preserve indirect references to
   null objects, we have to note this in ChangeLog and in the release
   notes since this will change output files.  We did this before when
   we stopped flattening scalar references, so this is probably not a
   big deal.  We also have to make sure that the testing for this
   handles non-trivial cases of the targets of indirect nulls being
   replaced by real objects in an update.  I'm not sure how this plays
   with linearization, if at all.  For cases where incremental updates
   are not being preserved as incremental updates and where the data
   is being folded in (as is always the case with qpdf now), none of
   this should make any difference in the actual semantics of the
   files.

 * When decrypting files with /R=6, hash_V5 is called more than once
   with the same inputs.  Caching the results or refactoring to reduce
   the number of identical calls could improve performance for
   workloads that involve processing large numbers of small files.

 * Consider providing a Windows installer for qpdf using NSIS.

 * Consider adding a method to balance the pages tree.  It would call
   pushInheritedAttributesToPage, construct a pages tree from scratch,
   and replace the /Pages key of the root dictionary with the new
   tree.

 * Secure random number generation could be made more efficient by
   using a local static to ensure a single random device or crypt
   provider as long as this can be done in a thread-safe fashion.  In
   the initial implementation, this is being skipped to avoid having
   to add any dependencies on threading libraries.

 * Study what's required to support savable forms that can be saved by
   Adobe Reader.  Does this require actually signing the document with
   an Adobe private key?  Search for "Digital signatures" in the PDF
   spec, and look at ~/Q/pdf-collection/form-with-full-save.pdf, which
   came from Adobe's example site.

 * Consider the possibility of doing something locale-aware to support
   non-ASCII passwords.  Update documentation if this is done.
   Consider implementing full Unicode password algorithms from newer
   encryption formats.

 * Consider impact of article threads on page splitting/merging.
   Subramanyam provided a test file; see ../misc/article-threads.pdf.
   Email Q-Count: 431864 from 2009-11-03.  Other things to consider:
   outlines, page labels, thumbnails, zones.  There are probably
   others.

 * See if we can avoid preserving unreferenced objects in object
   streams even when preserving the object streams.

 * For debugging linearization bugs, consider adding an option to save
   pass 1 of linearization.  This code is sufficient.  Change the
   interface to allow specification of a pass1 file, which would
   change the behavior as in this patch.

 * Provide APIs for embedded files.  See *attachments*.pdf in test
   suite.  The private method findAttachmentStreams finds at least
   cases for modern versions of Adobe Reader (>= 1.7, maybe earlier).
   PDF Reference 1.7 section 3.10, "File Specifications", discusses
   this.

   A sourceforge user asks if qpdf can handle extracting and embedded
   resources and references these tools, which may be useful as a
   reference.

 * The description of Crypt filters is unclear with respect to how to
   use them to override /StmF for specific streams.  I'm not sure
   whether qpdf will do the right thing for any specific individual
   streams that might have crypt filters, but I believe it does based
   on my testing of a limited subset.  The specification seems to imply
   that only embedded file streams and metadata streams can have crypt
   filters, and there are already special cases in the code to handle
   those.  Most likely, it won't be a problem, but someday someone may
   find a file that qpdf doesn't work on because of crypt filters.
   There is an example in the spec of using a crypt filter on a
   metadata stream.

   For now, we notice /Crypt filters and decode parameters consistent
   with the example in the PDF specification, and the right thing
   happens for metadata filters that happen to be uncompressed or
   otherwise compressed in a way we can filter.  This should handle
   all normal cases, but it's more or less just a guess since I don't
   have any test files that actually use stream-specific crypt filters
   in them.

 * The second xref stream for linearized files has to be padded only
   because we need file_size as computed in pass 1 to be accurate.  If
   we were not allowing writing to a pipe, we could seek back to the
   beginning and fill in the value of /L in the linearization
   dictionary as an optimization to alleviate the need for this
   padding.  Doing so would require us to pad the /L value
   individually and also to save the file descriptor and determine
   whether it's seekable.  This is probably not worth bothering with.

 * The whole xref handling code in the QPDF object allows the same
   object with more than one generation to coexist, but a lot of logic
   assumes this isn't the case.  Anything that creates mappings only
   with the object number and not the generation is this way,
   including most of the interaction between QPDFWriter and QPDF.  If
   we wanted to allow the same object with more than one generation to
   coexist, which I'm not sure is allowed, we could fix this by
   changing xref_table.  Alternatively, we could detect and disallow
   that case.  In fact, it appears that Adobe reader and other PDF
   viewing software silently ignores objects of this type, so this is
   probably not a big deal.

 * If we ever want to have check mode check the integrity of the free
   list, this can be done by looking at the code from prior to the
   object stream support of 4/5/2008.  It's in an if (0) block and
   there's a comment about it.  There's also something about it in
   qpdf.test -- search for "free table".  On the other hand, the value
   of doing this seems very low since no viewer seems to care, so it's
   probably not worth it.

 * QPDFObjectHandle::getPageImages() doesn't notice images in
   inherited resource dictionaries.  See comments in that function.

 * Based on an idea suggested by user "Atom Smasher", consider
   providing some mechanism to recover earlier versions of a file
   embedded prior to appended sections.

 * From a suggestion in bug 3152169, consider having an option to
   re-encode inline images with an ASCII encoding.

 * From github issue 2, provide more in-depth output for examining
   hint stream contents. Consider adding on option to provide a
   human-readable dump of linearization hint tables. This should
   include improving the 'overflow reading bit stream' message as
   reported in issue #2.
