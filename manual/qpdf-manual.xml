   QPDF was originally created in 2001 and modified periodically
   between 2001 and 2005 during my employment at <ulink
   url="http://www.apexcovantage.com">Apex CoVantage</ulink>.  Upon my
   departure from Apex, the company graciously allowed me to take
   ownership of the software and continue maintaining as an open
   source project, a decision for which I am very grateful.  I have
   made considerable enhancements to it since that time.  I feel
   fortunate to have worked for people who would make such a decision.
   This work would not have been possible without their support.

  <title>What is QPDF?</title>
  <para>
   QPDF is a program that does structural, content-preserving
   transformations on PDF files.  It could have been called something
   like <emphasis>pdf-to-pdf</emphasis>.  It also provides many useful
   capabilities to developers of PDF-producing software or for people
   who just want to look at the innards of a PDF file to learn more
   about how they work.
  </para>
  <para>
   With QPDF, it is possible to copy objects from one PDF file into
   another and to manipulate the list of pages in a PDF file.  This
   makes it possible to merge and split PDF files.  The QPDF library
   also makes it possible for you to create PDF files from scratch.
   In this mode, you are responsible for supplying all the contents of
   the file, while the QPDF library takes care off all the syntactical
   representation of the objects, creation of cross references tables
   and, if you use them, object streams, encryption, linearization,
   and other syntactic details.  You are still responsible for
   generating PDF content on your own.
  </para>
  <para>
   QPDF has been designed with very few external dependencies, and it
   is intentionally very lightweight.  QPDF is
   <emphasis>not</emphasis> a PDF content creation library, a PDF
   viewer, or a program capable of converting PDF into other formats.
   In particular, QPDF knows nothing about the semantics of PDF
   content streams.  If you are looking for something that can do
   that, you should look elsewhere.  However, once you have a valid
   PDF file, QPDF can be used to transform that file in ways perhaps
   your original PDF creation can't handle.  For example, many
   programs generate simple PDF files but can't password-protect them,
   web-optimize them, or perform other transformations of that type.

       is required to run the test suite.  Note that this is the
       version of diff present on virtually all GNU/Linux systems.
       This is required because the test suite uses <command>diff

       A C++ compiler that works well with STL and has the <type>long

       bill fine.  QPDF is tested with gcc and Microsoft Visual C++.

    </itemizedlist>
   </para>
   <para>
    Part of qpdf's test suite does comparisons of the contents PDF
    files by converting them images and comparing the images.  The
    image comparison tests are disabled by default.  Those tests are
    not required for determining correctness of a qpdf build if you
    have not modified the code since the test suite also contains
    expected output files that are compared literally.  The image
    comparison tests provide an extra check to make sure that any
    content transformations don't break the rendering of pages.
    Transformations that affect the content streams themselves are off
    by default and are only provided to help developers look into the
    contents of PDF files.  If you are making deep changes to the
    library that cause changes in the contents of the files that qpdf
    generates, then you should enable the image comparison tests.
    Enable them by running <command>configure</command> with the
    <option>--enable-test-compare-images</option> flag.  If you enable
    this, the following additional requirements are required by the
    test suite.  Note that in no case are these items required to use
    qpdf.

    If Adobe Reader is installed as <command>acroread</command>, some
    additional test cases will be enabled.  These test cases simply
    verify that Adobe Reader can open the files that qpdf creates.
    They require version 8.0 or newer to pass.  However, in order to
    avoid having qpdf depend on non-free (as in liberty) software, the
    test suite will still pass without Adobe reader, and the test
    suite still exercises the full functionality of the software.
   </para>
   <para>
    Pre-built documentation is distributed with qpdf, so you should
    generally not need to rebuild the documentation.  In order to
    build the documentation from its docbook sources, you need the
    docbook XML style sheets (<ulink
    url="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/docbook/">http://downloads.sourceforge.net/docbook/</ulink>).
    To build the PDF version of the documentation, you need Apache fop
    (<ulink
    url="http://xml.apache.org/fop/">http://xml.apache.org/fop/</ulink>)
    version 0.94 or higher.

    Building qpdf on UNIX is generally just a matter of running

    <programlisting>./configure
make
</programlisting>
    You can also run <command>make check</command> to run the test
    suite and <command>make install</command> to install.  Please run
    <command>./configure --help</command> for options on what can be
    configured.  You can also set the value of
    <varname>DESTDIR</varname> during installation to install to a
    temporary location, as is common with many open source packages.
    Please see also the <filename>README</filename> and
    <filename>INSTALL</filename> files in the source distribution.
   </para>
   <para>
    Building on Windows is a little bit more complicated.  For
    details, please see <filename>README-windows.txt</filename> in the
    source distribution.  You can also download a binary distribution
    for Windows.  There is a port of qpdf to Visual C++ version 6 in
    the <filename>contrib</filename> area generously contributed by
    Jian Ma.  This is also discussed in more detail in
    <filename>README-windows.txt</filename>.
   </para>
   <para>
    There are some other things you can do with the build.  Although
    qpdf uses <application>autoconf</application>, it does not use
    <application>automake</application> but instead uses a
    hand-crafted non-recursive Makefile that requires gnu make.  If
    you're really interested, please read the comments in the
    top-level <filename>Makefile</filename>.

 <chapter id="ref.using">
  <title>Running QPDF</title>
  <para>
   This chapter describes how to run the qpdf program from the command
   line.
  </para>
  <sect1 id="ref.invocation">
   <title>Basic Invocation</title>
   <para>
    When running qpdf, the basic invocation is as follows:

    <programlisting><command>qpdf</command><option> [ <replaceable>options</replaceable> ] <replaceable>infilename</replaceable> [ <replaceable>outfilename</replaceable> ]</option>
</programlisting>
    This converts PDF file <option>infilename</option> to PDF file
    <option>outfilename</option>.  The output file is functionally
    identical to the input file but may have been structurally
    reorganized.  Also, orphaned objects will be removed from the
    file.  Many transformations are available as controlled by the
    options below.  In place of <option>infilename</option>, the
    parameter <option>--empty</option> may be specified.  This causes
    qpdf to use a dummy input file that contains zero pages.  The only
    normal use case for using <option>--empty</option> would be if you
    were going to add pages from another source, as discussed in <xref
    linkend="ref.page-selection"/>.
   </para>
   <para>
    <option>outfilename</option> does not have to be seekable, even
    when generating linearized files.  Specifying
    &ldquo;<option>--</option>&rdquo; as <option>outfilename</option>
    means to write to standard output.  However, you can't specify the
    same file as both the input and the output because qpdf reads data
    from the input file as it writes to the output file.
   </para>
   <para>
    Most options require an output file, but some testing or
    inspection commands do not.  These are specifically noted.
   </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="ref.basic-options">
   <title>Basic Options</title>

       <para>
        Encrypt the file using the same encryption parameters,
        including user and owner password, as the specified file.  Use
        <option>--encrypt-file-password</option> to specify a password
        if one is needed to open this file.  Note that copying the
        encryption parameters from a file also copies the first half
        of <literal>/ID</literal> from the file since this is part of
        the encryption parameters.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term><option>--encrypt-file-password=password</option></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        If the file specified with <option>--copy-encryption</option>
        requires a password, specify the password using this option.
        Note that only one of the user or owner password is required.
        Both passwords will be preserved since QPDF does not
        distinguish between the two passwords.  It is possible to
        preserve encryption parameters, including the owner password,
        from a file even if you don't know the file's owner password.

     <varlistentry>
      <term><option>--pages options --</option></term>

        Select specific pages from one or more input files.  See <xref

        selection (splitting and merging).

     </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
   </para>
   <para>
    Password-protected files may be opened by specifying a password.
    By default, qpdf will preserve any encryption data associated with
    a file.  If <option>--decrypt</option> is specified, qpdf will
    attempt to remove any encryption information.  If
    <option>--encrypt</option> is specified, qpdf will replace the
    document's encryption parameters with whatever is specified.
   </para>
   <para>
    Note that qpdf does not obey encryption restrictions already
    imposed on the file.  Doing so would be meaningless since qpdf can
    be used to remove encryption from the file entirely.  This
    functionality is not intended to be used for bypassing copyright
    restrictions or other restrictions placed on files by their
    producers.
   </para>
   <para>
    In all cases where qpdf allows specification of a password, care
    must be taken if the password contains characters that fall
    outside of the 7-bit US-ASCII character range to ensure that the
    exact correct byte sequence is provided.  It is possible that a
    future version of qpdf may handle this more gracefully.  For
    example, if a password was encrypted using a password that was
    encoded in ISO-8859-1 and your terminal is configured to use
    UTF-8, the password you supply may not work properly.  There are
    various approaches to handling this.  For example, if you are
    using Linux and have the iconv executable (part of the ICU
    package) installed, you could pass <option>--password=`echo
    <replaceable>password</replaceable> | iconv -t
    iso-8859-1`</option> to qpdf where
    <replaceable>password</replaceable> is a password specified in
    your terminal's locale.  A detailed discussion of this is out of
    scope for this manual, but just be aware of this issue if you have
    trouble with a password that contains 8-bit characters.

        dictionary to be set to the value <literal>4</literal>.  As
        qpdf will automatically do this when required, there is no
        reason to ever use this option.  It exists primarily for use
        in testing qpdf itself.  This option also forces the PDF
        version to be at least 1.5.

   <title>Page Selection Options</title>
   <para>
    Starting with qpdf 3.0, it is possible to split and merge PDF
    files by selecting pages from one or more input files.  Whatever
    file is given as the primary input file is used as the starting
    point, but its pages are replaced with pages as specified.

    <programlisting><option>--pages <replaceable>input-file</replaceable> [ <replaceable>--password=password</replaceable> ] [ <replaceable>page-range</replaceable> ] [ ... ] --</option>
</programlisting>
    Multiple input files may be specified.  Each one is given as the
    name of the input file, an optional password (if required to open
    the file), and the range of pages.  Note that
    &ldquo;<option>--</option>&rdquo; terminates parsing of page
    selection flags.
   </para>
   <para>
    For each file that pages should be taken from, specify the file, a
    password needed to open the file (if any), and a page range.  The
    password needs to be given only once per file.  If any of the
    input files are the same as the primary input file or the file
    used to copy encryption parameters (if specified), you do not need
    to repeat the password here.  The same file can be repeated
    multiple times.  If a file that is repeated has a password, the
    password only has to be given the first time.  All non-page data
    (info, outlines, page numbers, etc.) are taken from the primary
    input file.  To discard these, use <option>--empty</option> as the
    primary input.
   </para>
   <para>
    Starting with qpdf 5.0.0, it is possible to omit the page range.
    If qpdf sees a value in the place where it expects a page range
    and that value is not a valid range but is a valid file name, qpdf
    will implicitly use the range <literal>1-z</literal>, meaning that
    it will include all pages in the file.  This makes it possible to
    easily combine all pages in a set of files with a command like
    <command>qpdf --empty out.pdf --pages *.pdf --</command>.
   </para>
   <para>
    It is not presently possible to specify the same page from the
    same file directly more than once, but you can make this work by
    specifying two different paths to the same file (such as by
    putting <filename>./</filename> somewhere in the path).  This can
    also be used if you want to repeat a page from one of the input
    files in the output file.  This may be made more convenient in a
    future version of qpdf if there is enough demand for this feature.
   </para>
   <para>
    The page range is a set of numbers separated by commas, ranges of
    numbers separated dashes, or combinations of those.  The character
    &ldquo;z&rdquo; represents the last page.  Pages can appear in any
    order.  Ranges can appear with a high number followed by a low
    number, which causes the pages to appear in reverse.  Repeating a
    number will cause an error, but you can use the workaround
    discussed above should you really want to include the same page
    twice.
   </para>
   <para>
    Example page ranges:
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <literal>1,3,5-9,15-12</literal>: pages 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8,
       9, 15, 14, 13, and 12.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <literal>z-1</literal>: all pages in the document in reverse
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   </para>
   <para>
    Note that qpdf doesn't presently do anything special about other
    constructs in a PDF file that may know about pages, so semantics
    of splitting and merging vary across features.  For example, the
    document's outlines (bookmarks) point to actual page objects, so
    if you select some pages and not others, bookmarks that point to
    pages that are in the output file will work, and remaining
    bookmarks will not work.  On the other hand, page labels (page
    numbers specified in the file) are just sequential, so page labels
    will be messed up in the output file.  A future version of
    <command>qpdf</command> may do a better job at handling these
    issues.  (Note that the qpdf library already contains all of the
    APIs required in order to implement this in your own application
    if you need it.)  In the mean time, you can always use
    <option>--empty</option> as the primary input file to avoid
    copying all of that from the first file.  For example, to take
    pages 1 through 5 from a <filename>infile.pdf</filename> while
    preserving all metadata associated with that file, you could use

    <programlisting><command>qpdf</command> <option>infile.pdf --pages infile.pdf 1-5 -- outfile.pdf</option>
</programlisting>
    If you wanted pages 1 through 5 from
    <filename>infile.pdf</filename> but you wanted the rest of the
    metadata to be dropped, you could instead run

    <programlisting><command>qpdf</command> <option>--empty --pages infile.pdf 1-5 -- outfile.pdf</option>
</programlisting>
    If you wanted to take pages 1&ndash;5 from
    <filename>file1.pdf</filename> and pages 11&ndash;15 from
    <filename>file2.pdf</filename> in reverse, you would run

    <programlisting><command>qpdf</command> <option>file1.pdf --pages file1.pdf 1-5 file2.pdf 15-11 -- outfile.pdf</option>
</programlisting>
    If, for some reason, you wanted to take the first page of an
    encrypted file called <filename>encrypted.pdf</filename> with
    password <literal>pass</literal> and repeat it twice in an output
    file, and if you wanted to drop metadata (like page numbers and
    outlines) but preserve encryption, you would use

    <programlisting><command>qpdf</command> <option>--empty --copy-encryption=encrypted.pdf --encryption-file-password=pass
--pages encrypted.pdf --password=pass 1 ./encrypted.pdf --password=pass 1 --
outfile.pdf</option>
</programlisting>
    Note that we had to specify the password all three times because
    giving a password as <option>--encryption-file-password</option>
    doesn't count for page selection, and as far as qpdf is concerned,
    <filename>encrypted.pdf</filename> and
    <filename>./encrypted.pdf</filename> are separated files.  These
    are all corner cases that most users should hopefully never have
    to be bothered with.

        Forces the PDF version of the output file to be at least
        <replaceable>version</replaceable>.  In other words, if the
        input file has a lower version than the specified version, the
        specified version will be used.  If the input file has a
        higher version, the input file's original version will be
        used.  It is seldom necessary to use this option since qpdf
        will automatically increase the version as needed when adding
        features that require newer PDF readers.
       </para>

        The version number may be expressed in the form

        <replaceable>major.minor</replaceable> at extension level
        <replaceable>extension-level</replaceable>.  For example,
        version <literal>1.7.8</literal> represents version 1.7 at

        This option forces the PDF version to be the exact version
        specified <emphasis>even when the file may have content that
        is not supported in that version</emphasis>.  The version
        number is interpreted in the same way as with
        <option>--min-version</option> so that extension levels can be
        set.  In some cases, forcing the output file's PDF version to
        be lower than that of the input file will cause qpdf to
        disable certain features of the document.  Specifically,
        256-bit keys are disabled if the version is less than 1.7 with
        extension level 8 (except R5 is disabled if less than 1.7 with
        extension level 3), AES encryption is disabled if the version
        is less than 1.6, cleartext metadata and object streams are
        disabled if less than 1.5, 128-bit encryption keys are
        disabled if less than 1.4, and all encryption is disabled if
        less than 1.3.  Even with these precautions, qpdf won't be
        able to do things like eliminate use of newer image
        compression schemes, transparency groups, or other features
        that may have been added in more recent versions of PDF.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a general rule, with the exception of big structural things
        like the use of object streams or AES encryption, PDF viewers
        are supposed to ignore features in files that they don't
        support from newer versions.  This means that forcing the
        version to a lower version may make it possible to open your
        PDF file with an older version, though bear in mind that some
        of the original document's functionality may be lost.

    By default, when a stream is encoded using non-lossy filters that
    qpdf understands and is not already compressed using a good
    compression scheme, qpdf will uncompress and recompress streams.
    Assuming proper filter implements, this is safe and generally
    results in smaller files.  This behavior may also be explicitly
    requested with <option>--stream-data=compress</option>.
   </para>
   <para>
    When <option>--stream-data=preserve</option> is specified, qpdf
    will never attempt to change the filtering of any stream data.
   </para>
   <para>
    When <option>--stream-data=uncompress</option> is specified, qpdf
    will attempt to remove any non-lossy filters that it supports.
    This includes <literal>/FlateDecode</literal>,
    <literal>/LZWDecode</literal>, <literal>/ASCII85Decode</literal>,
    and <literal>/ASCIIHexDecode</literal>.  This can be very useful
    for inspecting the contents of various streams.
   </para>
   <para>
    When <option>--normalize-content=y</option> is specified, qpdf
    will attempt to normalize whitespace and newlines in page content
    streams.  This is generally safe but could, in some cases, cause
    damage to the content streams.  This option is intended for people
    who wish to study PDF content streams or to debug PDF content.
    You should not use this for &ldquo;production&rdquo; PDF files.
   </para>
   <para>
    Ordinarily, qpdf will attempt to recover from certain types of
    errors in PDF files.  These include errors in the cross-reference
    table, certain types of object numbering errors, and certain types
    of stream length errors.  Sometimes, qpdf may think it has
    recovered but may not have actually recovered, so care should be
    taken when using this option as some data loss is possible.  The
    <option>--suppress-recovery</option> option will prevent qpdf from
    attempting recovery.  In this case, it will fail on the first
    error that it encounters.
   </para>
   <para>
    Object streams, also known as compressed objects, were introduced
    into the PDF specification at version 1.5, corresponding to
    Acrobat 6.  Some older PDF viewers may not support files with
    object streams.  qpdf can be used to transform files with object
    streams to files without object streams or vice versa.  As
    mentioned above, there are three object stream modes:
    <option>preserve</option>, <option>disable</option>, and
    <option>generate</option>.
   </para>
   <para>
    In <option>preserve</option> mode, the relationship to objects and
    the streams that contain them is preserved from the original file.
    In <option>disable</option> mode, all objects are written as
    regular, uncompressed objects.  The resulting file should be
    readable by older PDF viewers.  (Of course, the content of the
    files may include features not supported by older viewers, but at
    least the structure will be supported.)  In
    <option>generate</option> mode, qpdf will create its own object
    streams.  This will usually result in more compact PDF files,
    though they may not be readable by older viewers.  In this mode,
    qpdf will also make sure the PDF version number in the header is
    at least 1.5.
   </para>
   <para>
    Ordinarily, qpdf reads cross-reference streams when they are
    present in a PDF file.  If <option>--ignore-xref-streams</option>
    is specified, qpdf will ignore any cross-reference streams for
    hybrid PDF files.  The purpose of hybrid files is to make some
    content available to viewers that are not aware of cross-reference
    streams.  It is almost never desirable to ignore them.  The only
    time when you might want to use this feature is if you are testing
    creation of hybrid PDF files and wish to see how a PDF consumer
    that doesn't understand object and cross-reference streams would
    interpret such a file.
   </para>
   <para>
    The <option>--qdf</option> flag turns on QDF mode, which changes
    some of the defaults described above.  Specifically, in QDF mode,
    by default, stream data is uncompressed, content streams are
    normalized, and encryption is removed.  These defaults can still
    be overridden by specifying the appropriate options as described
    above.  Additionally, in QDF mode, stream lengths are stored as
    indirect objects, objects are laid out in a less efficient but
    more readable fashion, and the documents are interspersed with
    comments that make it easier for the user to find things and also
    make it possible for <command>fix-qdf</command> to work properly.
    QDF mode is intended for people, mostly developers, who wish to
    inspect or modify PDF files in a text editor.  For details, please
    see <xref linkend="ref.qdf"/>.

        cost, the /ID field is generated to include a digest of the
        significant parts of the content of the output PDF file. This
        means that a given qpdf operation should generate the same /ID
        each time it is run, which can be useful when caching results
        or for generation of some test data. Use of this flag is not

 <chapter id="ref.qdf">
  <title>QDF Mode</title>
  <para>
   In QDF mode, qpdf creates PDF files in what we call <firstterm>QDF
   form</firstterm>.  A PDF file in QDF form, sometimes called a QDF
   file, is a completely valid PDF file that has
   <literal>%QDF-1.0</literal> as its third line (after the pdf header
   and binary characters) and has certain other characteristics.  The
   purpose of QDF form is to make it possible to edit PDF files, with
   some restrictions, in an ordinary text editor.  This can be very
   useful for experimenting with different PDF constructs or for
   making one-off edits to PDF files (though there are other reasons
   why this may not always work).
  </para>
  <para>
   It is ordinarily very difficult to edit PDF files in a text editor
   for two reasons: most meaningful data in PDF files is compressed,
   and PDF files are full of offset and length information that makes
   it hard to add or remove data.  A QDF file is organized in a manner
   such that, if edits are kept within certain constraints, the
   <command>fix-qdf</command> program, distributed with qpdf, is able
   to restore edited files to a correct state.  The
   <command>fix-qdf</command> program takes no command-line
   arguments.  It reads a possibly edited QDF file from standard input
   and writes a repaired file to standard output.
  </para>
  <para>
   The following attributes characterize a QDF file:
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      All objects appear in numerical order in the PDF file, including
      when objects appear in object streams.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Objects are printed in an easy-to-read format, and all line
      endings are normalized to UNIX line endings.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Unless specifically overridden, streams appear uncompressed
      (when qpdf supports the filters and they are compressed with a
      non-lossy compression scheme), and most content streams are
      normalized (line endings are converted to just a UNIX-style
      linefeeds).
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      All streams lengths are represented as indirect objects, and the
      stream length object is always the next object after the stream.
      If the stream data does not end with a newline, an extra newline
      is inserted, and a special comment appears after the stream
      indicating that this has been done.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      If the PDF file contains object streams, if object stream
      <emphasis>n</emphasis> contains <emphasis>k</emphasis> objects,
      those objects are numbered from <emphasis>n+1</emphasis> through
      <emphasis>n+k</emphasis>, and the object number/offset pairs
      appear on a separate line for each object.  Additionally, each
      object in the object stream is preceded by a comment indicating
      its object number and index.  This makes it very easy to find
      objects in object streams.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      All beginnings of objects, <literal>stream</literal> tokens,
      <literal>endstream</literal> tokens, and
      <literal>endobj</literal> tokens appear on lines by themselves.
      A blank line follows every <literal>endobj</literal> token.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      If there is a cross-reference stream, it is unfiltered.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Page dictionaries and page content streams are marked with
      special comments that make them easy to find.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Comments precede each object indicating the object number of the
      corresponding object in the original file.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>
  <para>
   When editing a QDF file, any edits can be made as long as the above
   constraints are maintained.  This means that you can freely edit a
   page's content without worrying about messing up the QDF file.  It
   is also possible to add new objects so long as those objects are
   added after the last object in the file or subsequent objects are
   renumbered.  If a QDF file has object streams in it, you can always
   add the new objects before the xref stream and then change the
   number of the xref stream, since nothing generally ever references
   it by number.
  </para>
  <para>
   It is not generally practical to remove objects from QDF files
   without messing up object numbering, but if you remove all
   references to an object, you can run qpdf on the file (after
   running <command>fix-qdf</command>), and qpdf will omit the
   now-orphaned object.
  </para>
  <para>
   When <command>fix-qdf</command> is run, it goes through the file
   and recomputes the following parts of the file:
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      the <literal>/N</literal>, <literal>/W</literal>, and
      <literal>/First</literal> keys of all object stream dictionaries

    All header files are installed in the <filename>include/qpdf</filename> directory.  It

   <title>Introduction</title>
   <para>
    This section was written prior to the implementation of the qpdf
    package and was subsequently modified to reflect the
    implementation.  In some cases, for purposes of explanation, it
    may differ slightly from the actual implementation.  As always,
    the source code and test suite are authoritative.  Even if there
    are some errors, this document should serve as a road map to
    understanding how this code works.
   </para>
   <para>
    In general, one should adhere strictly to a specification when
    writing but be liberal in reading.  This way, the product of our
    software will be accepted by the widest range of other programs,
    and we will accept the widest range of input files.  This library
    attempts to conform to that philosophy whenever possible but also
    aims to provide strict checking for people who want to validate
    PDF files.  If you don't want to see warnings and are trying to
    write something that is tolerant, you can call
    <literal>setSuppressWarnings(true)</literal>.  If you want to fail
    on the first error, you can call
    <literal>setAttemptRecovery(false)</literal>.  The default
    behavior is to generating warnings for recoverable problems.  Note
    that recovery will not always produce the desired results even if
    it is able to get through the file.  Unlike most other PDF files
    that produce generic warnings such as &ldquo;This file is
    damaged,&rdquo;, qpdf generally issues a detailed error message
    that would be most useful to a PDF developer.  This is by design
    as there seems to be a shortage of PDF validation tools out
    there.  (This was, in fact, one of the major motivations behind
    the initial creation of qpdf.)

  <sect1 id="ref.design-goals">
   <title>Design Goals</title>
   <para>
    The QPDF package includes support for reading and rewriting PDF
    files.  It aims to hide from the user details involving object
    locations, modified (appended) PDF files, the
    directness/indirectness of objects, and stream filters including
    encryption.  It does not aim to hide knowledge of the object
    hierarchy or content stream contents.  Put another way, a user of
    the qpdf library is expected to have knowledge about how PDF files
    work, but is not expected to have to keep track of bookkeeping
    details such as file positions.
   </para>
   <para>
    A user of the library never has to care whether an object is
    direct or indirect.  All access to objects deals with this
    transparently.  All memory management details are also handled by
    the library.
   </para>
   <para>
    The <classname>PointerHolder</classname> object is used internally
    by the library to deal with memory management.  This is basically
    a smart pointer object very similar in spirit to the Boost
    library's <classname>shared_ptr</classname> object, but predating
    it by several years.  This library also makes use of a technique
    for giving fine-grained access to methods in one class to other
    classes by using public subclasses with friends and only private
    members that in turn call private methods of the containing class.
    See <classname>QPDFObjectHandle::Factory</classname> as an
    example.
   </para>
   <para>
    The top-level qpdf class is <classname>QPDF</classname>.  A
    <classname>QPDF</classname> object represents a PDF file.  The
    library provides methods for both accessing and mutating PDF
    files.
   </para>
   <para>
    <classname>QPDFObject</classname> is the basic PDF Object class.
    It is an abstract base class from which are derived classes for
    each type of PDF object.  Clients do not interact with Objects
    directly but instead interact with
    <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname>.
   </para>
   <para>
    <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname> contains
    <classname>PointerHolder&lt;QPDFObject&gt;</classname> and
    includes accessor methods that are type-safe proxies to the
    methods of the derived object classes as well as methods for
    querying object types.  They can be passed around by value,
    copied, stored in containers, etc. with very low overhead.
    Instances of <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname> always
    contain a reference back to the <classname>QPDF</classname> object
    from which they were created.  A
    <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname> may be direct or indirect.
    If indirect, the <classname>QPDFObject</classname> the
    <classname>PointerHolder</classname> initially points to is a null
    pointer.  In this case, the first attempt to access the underlying
    <classname>QPDFObject</classname> will result in the
    <classname>QPDFObject</classname> being resolved via a call to the
    referenced <classname>QPDF</classname> instance.  This makes it
    essentially impossible to make coding errors in which certain
    things will work for some PDF files and not for others based on
    which objects are direct and which objects are indirect.
   </para>
   <para>
    Instances of <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname> can be
    directly created and modified using static factory methods in the
    <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname> class. There are factory
    methods for each type of object as well as a convenience method
    <function>QPDFObjectHandle::parse</function> that creates an
    object from a string representation of the object.  Existing
    instances of <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname> can also be
    modified in several ways.  See comments in
    <filename>QPDFObjectHandle.hh</filename> for details.
   </para>
   <para>
    When the <classname>QPDF</classname> class creates a new object,
    it dynamically allocates the appropriate type of
    <classname>QPDFObject</classname> and immediately hands the
    pointer to an instance of <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname>.
    The parser reads a token from the current file position.  If the
    token is a not either a dictionary or array opener, an object is
    immediately constructed from the single token and the parser
    returns.  Otherwise, the parser is invoked recursively in a
    special mode in which it accumulates objects until it finds a
    balancing closer.  During this process, the
    &ldquo;<literal>R</literal>&rdquo; keyword is recognized and an
    indirect <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname> may be
    constructed.
   </para>
   <para>
    The <function>QPDF::resolve()</function> method, which is used to
    resolve an indirect object, may be invoked from the
    <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname> class.  It first checks a
    cache to see whether this object has already been read.  If not,
    it reads the object from the PDF file and caches it.  It the
    returns the resulting <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname>.
    The calling object handle then replaces its
    <classname>PointerHolder&lt;QDFObject&gt;</classname> with the one
    from the newly returned <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname>.
    In this way, only a single copy of any direct object need exist
    and clients can access objects transparently without knowing
    caring whether they are direct or indirect objects.  Additionally,
    no object is ever read from the file more than once.  That means
    that only the portions of the PDF file that are actually needed
    are ever read from the input file, thus allowing the qpdf package
    to take advantage of this important design goal of PDF files.
   </para>
   <para>
    If the requested object is inside of an object stream, the object
    stream itself is first read into memory.  Then the tokenizer reads
    objects from the memory stream based on the offset information
    stored in the stream.  Those individual objects are cached, after
    which the temporary buffer holding the object stream contents are
    discarded.  In this way, the first time an object in an object
    stream is requested, all objects in the stream are cached.
   </para>
   <para>
    An instance of <classname>QPDF</classname> is constructed by using
    the class's default constructor.  If desired, the
    <classname>QPDF</classname> object may be configured with various
    methods that change its default behavior.  Then the
    <function>QPDF::processFile()</function> method is passed the name
    of a PDF file, which permanently associates the file with that
    QPDF object.  A password may also be given for access to
    password-protected files.  QPDF does not enforce encryption
    parameters and will treat user and owner passwords equivalently.
    Either password may be used to access an encrypted file.
    <footnote>
     <para>
      As pointed out earlier, the intention is not for qpdf to be used
      to bypass security on files. but as any open source PDF consumer
      may be easily modified to bypass basic PDF document security,
      and qpdf offers may transformations that can do this as well,
      there seems to be little point in the added complexity of
      conditionally enforcing document security.
     </para>
    </footnote>
    <classname>QPDF</classname> will allow recovery of a user password
    given an owner password.  The input PDF file must be seekable.
    (Output files written by <classname>QPDFWriter</classname> need
    not be seekable, even when creating linearized files.)  During
    construction, <classname>QPDF</classname> validates the PDF file's
    header, and then reads the cross reference tables and trailer
    dictionaries.  The <classname>QPDF</classname> class keeps only
    the first trailer dictionary though it does read all of them so it
    can check the <literal>/Prev</literal> key.
    <classname>QPDF</classname> class users may request the root
    object and the trailer dictionary specifically.  The cross
    reference table is kept private.  Objects may then be requested by
    number of by walking the object tree.
   </para>
   <para>
    When a PDF file has a cross-reference stream instead of a
    cross-reference table and trailer, requesting the document's
    trailer dictionary returns the stream dictionary from the
    cross-reference stream instead.
   </para>
   <para>
    There are some convenience routines for very common operations
    such as walking the page tree and returning a vector of all page
    objects.  For full details, please see the header file
    <filename>QPDF.hh</filename>.
   </para>
   <para>
    The following example should clarify how
    <classname>QPDF</classname> processes a simple file.

      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       The <classname>QPDF</classname> class checks the beginning of
       <filename>a.pdf</filename> for
       <literal>%!PDF-1.[0-9]+</literal>.  It then reads the cross
       reference table mentioned at the end of the file, ensuring that
       it is looking before the last <literal>%%EOF</literal>.  After
       getting to <literal>trailer</literal> keyword, it invokes the
       parser.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       The parser sees &ldquo;<literal>&lt;&lt;</literal>&rdquo;, so
       it calls itself recursively in dictionary creation mode.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       In dictionary creation mode, the parser keeps accumulating
       objects until it encounters
       &ldquo;<literal>&gt;&gt;</literal>&rdquo;.  Each object that is
       read is pushed onto a stack.  If
       &ldquo;<literal>R</literal>&rdquo; is read, the last two
       objects on the stack are inspected.  If they are integers, they
       are popped off the stack and their values are used to construct
       an indirect object handle which is then pushed onto the stack.
       When &ldquo;<literal>&gt;&gt;</literal>&rdquo; is finally read,
       the stack is converted into a
       <classname>QPDF_Dictionary</classname> which is placed in a
       <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname> and returned.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>

   <title>Casting Policy</title>
   <para>
    This section describes the casting policy followed by qpdf's
    implementation.  This is no concern to qpdf's end users and
    largely of no concern to people writing code that uses qpdf, but
    it could be of interest to people who are porting qpdf to a new
    platform or who are making modifications to the code.
   </para>
   <para>
    The C++ code in qpdf is free of old-style casts except where
    unavoidable (e.g. where the old-style cast is in a macro provided
    by a third-party header file).  When there is a need for a cast,
    it is handled, in order of preference, by rewriting the code to
    avoid the need for a cast, calling
    <function>const_cast</function>, calling
    <function>static_cast</function>, calling
    <function>reinterpret_cast</function>, or calling some combination
    of the above.  As a last resort, a compiler-specific
    <literal>#pragma</literal> may be used to suppress a warning that
    we don't want to fix.  Examples may include suppressing warnings
    about the use of old-style casts in code that is shared between C
    and C++ code.
   </para>
   <para>
    The casting policy explicitly prohibits casting between integer
    sizes for no purpose other than to quiet a compiler warning when
    there is no reasonable chance of a problem resulting.  The reason
    for this exclusion is that the practice of adding these additional
    casts precludes future use of additional compiler warnings as a
    tool for making future improvements to this aspect of the code,
    and it also damages the readability of the code.
   </para>
   <para>
    There are a few significant areas where casting is common in the
    qpdf sources or where casting would be required to quiet higher
    levels of compiler warnings but is omitted at present:
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <type>char</type> vs. <type>unsigned char</type>.  For
       historical reasons, there are a lot of places in qpdf's
       internals that deal with <type>unsigned char</type>, which
       means that a lot of casting is required to interoperate with
       standard library calls and <type>std::string</type>.  In
       retrospect, qpdf should have probably used regular (signed)
       <type>char</type> and <type>char*</type> everywhere and just
       cast to <type>unsigned char</type> when needed, but it's too
       late to make that change now.  There are
       <function>reinterpret_cast</function> calls to go between
       <type>char*</type> and <type>unsigned char*</type>, and there
       are <function>static_cast</function> calls to go between
       <type>char</type> and <type>unsigned char</type>.  These should
       always be safe.

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Non-const <type>unsigned char*</type> used in the
       <type>Pipeline</type> interface.  The pipeline interface has a
       <function>write</function> call that uses <type>unsigned
       char*</type> without a <type>const</type> qualifier.  The main
       reason for this is to support pipelines that make calls to
       third-party libraries, such as zlib, that don't include
       <type>const</type> in their interfaces.  Unfortunately, there
       are many places in the code where it is desirable to have
       <type>const char*</type> with pipelines.  None of the pipeline
       implementations in qpdf currently modify the data passed to
       write, and doing so would be counter to the intent of
       <type>Pipeline</type>, but there is nothing in the code to
       prevent this from being done.  There are places in the code
       where <function>const_cast</function> is used to remove the
       const-ness of pointers going into <type>Pipeline</type>s.  This
       could theoretically be unsafe, but there is adequate testing to
       assert that it is safe and will remain safe in qpdf's code.

     <listitem>
      <para>
       <type>size_t</type> vs. <type>qpdf_offset_t</type>.  This is
       pretty much unavoidable since sizes are unsigned types and
       offsets are signed types.  Whenever it is necessary to seek by
       an amount given by a <type>size_t</type>, it becomes necessary
       to mix and match between <type>size_t</type> and
       <type>qpdf_offset_t</type>.  Additionally, qpdf sometimes
       treats memory buffers like files (as with
       <type>BufferInputSource</type>, and those seek interfaces have
       to be consistent with file-based input sources.  Neither gcc
       nor MSVC give warnings for this case by default, but both have
       warning flags that can enable this.  (MSVC:
       <option>/W14267</option> or <option>/W3</option>, which also
       enables some additional warnings that we ignore; gcc:
       <option>-Wconversion -Wsign-conversion</option>).  This could
       matter for files whose sizes are larger than
       2<superscript>63</superscript> bytes, but it is reasonable to
       expect that a world where such files are common would also have
       larger <type>size_t</type> and <type>qpdf_offset_t</type> types
       in it.  On most 64-bit systems at the time of this writing (the
       release of version 4.1.0 of qpdf), both <type>size_t</type> and
       <type>qpdf_offset_t</type> are 64-bit integer types, while on
       many current 32-bit systems, <type>size_t</type> is a 32-bit
       type while <type>qpdf_offset_t</type> is a 64-bit type.  I am
       not aware of any cases where 32-bit systems that have
       <type>size_t</type> smaller than <type>qpdf_offset_t</type>
       could run into problems.  Although I can't conclusively rule
       out the possibility of such problems existing, I suspect any
       cases would be pretty contrived.  In the event that someone
       should produce a file that qpdf can't handle because of what is
       suspected to be issues involving the handling of
       <type>size_t</type> vs. <type>qpdf_offset_t</type> (such files
       may behave properly on 64-bit systems but not on 32-bit systems
       because they have very large embedded files or streams, for
       example), the above mentioned warning flags could be enabled
       and all those implicit conversions could be carefully
       scrutinized.  (I have already gone through that exercise once
       in adding support for files larger than 4&nbsp;GB in size.)  I
       continue to be committed to supporting large files on 32-bit
       systems, but I would not go to any lengths to support corner
       cases involving large embedded files or large streams that work
       on 64-bit systems but not on 32-bit systems because of
       <type>size_t</type> being too small.  It is reasonable to
       assume that anyone working with such files would be using a
       64-bit system anyway since many 32-bit applications would have
       similar difficulties.

       <type>size_t</type> vs. <type>int</type> or <type>long</type>.
       There are some cases where <type>size_t</type> and

       and <type>unsigned int</type> or <type>unsigned long</type> are
       used interchangeably.  These cases occur when working with very
       small amounts of memory, such as with the bit readers (where
       we're working with just a few bytes at a time), some cases of
       <function>strlen</function>, and a few other cases.  I have
       scrutinized all of these cases and determined them to be safe,
       but there is no mechanism in the code to ensure that new unsafe
       conversions between <type>int</type> and <type>size_t</type>
       aren't introduced short of good testing and strong awareness of
       the issues.  Again, if any such bugs are suspected in the
       future, enabling the additional warning flags and scrutinizing
       the warnings would be in order.

    To be clear, I believe qpdf to be well-behaved with respect to
    sizes and offsets, and qpdf's test suite includes actual
    generation and full processing of files larger than 4&nbsp;GB in
    size.  The issues raised here are largely academic and should not
    in any way be interpreted to mean that qpdf has practical problems
    involving sloppiness with integer types.  I also believe that
    appropriate measures have been taken in the code to avoid problems
    with signed vs. unsigned integers from resulting in memory
    overwrites or other issues with potential security implications,
    though there are never any absolute guarantees.

  <sect1 id="ref.encryption">
   <title>Encryption</title>
   <para>
    Encryption is supported transparently by qpdf.  When opening a PDF
    file, if an encryption dictionary exists, the
    <classname>QPDF</classname> object processes this dictionary using
    the password (if any) provided.  The primary decryption key is
    computed and cached.  No further access is made to the encryption
    dictionary after that time.  When an object is read from a file,
    the object ID and generation of the object in which it is
    contained is always known.  Using this information along with the
    stored encryption key, all stream and string objects are
    transparently decrypted.  Raw encrypted objects are never stored
    in memory.  This way, nothing in the library ever has to know or
    care whether it is reading an encrypted file.
   </para>
   <para>
    An interface is also provided for writing encrypted streams and
    strings given an encryption key.  This is used by
    <classname>QPDFWriter</classname> when it rewrites encrypted
    files.
   </para>
   <para>
    When copying encrypted files, unless otherwise directed, qpdf will
    preserve any encryption in force in the original file.  qpdf can
    do this with either the user or the owner password.  There is no
    difference in capability based on which password is used.  When 40
    or 128 bit encryption keys are used, the user password can be
    recovered with the owner password.  With 256 keys, the user and
    owner passwords are used independently to encrypt the actual
    encryption key, so while either can be used, the owner password
    can no longer be used to recover the user password.
   </para>
   <para>
    Starting with version 4.0.0, qpdf can read files that are not
    encrypted but that contain encrypted attachments, but it cannot
    write such files.  qpdf also requires the password to be specified
    in order to open the file, not just to extract attachments, since
    once the file is open, all decryption is handled transparently.
    When copying files like this while preserving encryption, qpdf
    will apply the file's encryption to everything in the file, not
    just to the attachments.  When decrypting the file, qpdf will
    decrypt the attachments.  In general, when copying PDF files with
    multiple encryption formats, qpdf will choose the newest format.
    The only exception to this is that clear-text metadata will be
    preserved as clear-text if it is that way in the original file.

   <title>Random Number Generation</title>
   <para>
    QPDF generates random numbers to support generation of encrypted
    data.  Versions prior to 5.0.1 used <function>random</function> or
    <function>rand</function> from <filename>stdlib</filename> to
    generate random numbers.  Version 5.0.1, if available, used
    operating system-provided secure random number generation instead,
    enabling use of <filename>stdlib</filename> random number
    generation only if enabled by a compile-time option.  Starting in
    version 5.1.0, use of insecure random numbers was disabled unless
    enabled at compile time.  Starting in version 5.1.0, it is also
    possible for you to disable use of OS-provided secure random
    numbers.  This is especially useful on Windows if you want to
    avoid a dependency on Microsoft's cryptography API.  In this case,
    you must provide your own random data provider.  Regardless of how
    you compile qpdf, starting in version 5.1.0, it is possible for
    you to provide your own random data provider at runtime.  This
    would enable you to use some software-based secure pseudorandom
    number generator and to avoid use of whatever the operating system
    provides.  For details on how to do this, please refer to the
    top-level README file in the source distribution and to comments

   <title>Adding and Removing Pages</title>
   <para>
    While qpdf's API has supported adding and modifying objects for
    some time, version 3.0 introduces specific methods for adding and
    removing pages.  These are largely convenience routines that
    handle two tricky issues: pushing inheritable resources from the
    <literal>/Pages</literal> tree down to individual pages and
    manipulation of the <literal>/Pages</literal> tree itself.  For
    details, see <function>addPage</function> and surrounding methods

  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="ref.reserved-objects">
   <title>Reserving Object Numbers</title>
   <para>
    Version 3.0 of qpdf introduced the concept of reserved objects.
    These are seldom needed for ordinary operations, but there are
    cases in which you may want to add a series of indirect objects
    with references to each other to a <classname>QPDF</classname>
    object.  This causes a problem because you can't determine the
    object ID that a new indirect object will have until you add it to
    the <classname>QPDF</classname> object with
    <function>QPDF::makeIndirectObject</function>.  The only way to
    add two mutually referential objects to a
    <classname>QPDF</classname> object prior to version 3.0 would be
    to add the new objects first and then make them refer to each
    other after adding them.  Now it is possible to create a
    <firstterm>reserved object</firstterm> using
    <function>QPDFObjectHandle::newReserved</function>.  This is an
    indirect object that stays &ldquo;unresolved&rdquo; even if it is
    queried for its type.  So now, if you want to create a set of
    mutually referential objects, you can create reservations for each
    one of them and use those reservations to construct the
    references.  When finished, you can call
    <function>QPDF::replaceReserved</function> to replace the reserved
    objects with the real ones.  This functionality will never be
    needed by most applications, but it is used internally by QPDF
    when copying objects from other PDF files, as discussed in <xref
    linkend="ref.foreign-objects"/>.  For an example of how to use
    reserved objects, search for <function>newReserved</function> in
    <filename>test_driver.cc</filename> in qpdf's sources.

  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="ref.foreign-objects">
   <title>Copying Objects From Other PDF Files</title>
   <para>
    Version 3.0 of qpdf introduced the ability to copy objects into a
    <classname>QPDF</classname> object from a different
    <classname>QPDF</classname> object, which we refer to as
    <firstterm>foreign objects</firstterm>.  This allows arbitrary
    merging of PDF files.  The <command>qpdf</command> command-line
    tool provides limited support for basic page selection, including
    merging in pages from other files, but the library's API makes it
    possible to implement arbitrarily complex merging operations.  The
    main method for copying foreign objects is
    <function>QPDF::copyForeignObject</function>.  This takes an
    indirect object from another <classname>QPDF</classname> and
    copies it recursively into this object while preserving all object
    structure, including circular references.  This means you can add
    a direct object that you create from scratch to a
    <classname>QPDF</classname> object with
    <function>QPDF::makeIndirectObject</function>, and you can add an
    indirect object from another file with
    <function>QPDF::copyForeignObject</function>.  The fact that
    <function>QPDF::makeIndirectObject</function> does not
    automatically detect a foreign object and copy it is an explicit
    design decision.  Copying a foreign object seems like a
    sufficiently significant thing to do that it should be done
    explicitly.
   </para>
   <para>
    The other way to copy foreign objects is by passing a page from
    one <classname>QPDF</classname> to another by calling
    <function>QPDF::addPage</function>.  In contrast to
    <function>QPDF::makeIndirectObject</function>, this method
    automatically distinguishes between indirect objects in the
    current file, foreign objects, and direct objects.

    will have been skipped.  The new cross-reference table will
    contain an offset for every new object number from 1 up to the
    number of objects written.  This can be used to write out a new

    PDF file must be altered such that all page attributes are
    propagated down to the page level (and not inherited from parents
    in the <literal>/Pages</literal> tree).  We also have to know
    which objects refer to which other objects, being concerned with
    page boundaries and a few other cases.  We refer to this part of
    preparing the PDF file as <firstterm>optimization</firstterm>,

    In order to perform various operations such as linearization and

    are referenced by which pages, page thumbnails, and root and

   <title>Writing Linearized Files</title>
   <para>
    We will create files with only primary hint streams.  We will
    never write overflow hint streams.  (As of PDF version 1.4,
    Acrobat doesn't either, and they are never necessary.)  The hint
    streams contain offset information to objects that point to where
    they would be if the hint stream were not present.  This means
    that we have to calculate all object positions before we can
    generate and write the hint table.  This means that we have to
    generate the file in two passes.  To make this reliable,
    <classname>QPDFWriter</classname> in linearization mode invokes
    exactly the same code twice to write the file to a pipeline.
   </para>
   <para>
    In the first pass, the target pipeline is a count pipeline chained
    to a discard pipeline.  The count pipeline simply passes its data
    through to the next pipeline in the chain but can return the
    number of bytes passed through it at any intermediate point.  The
    discard pipeline is an end of line pipeline that just throws its
    data away.  The hint stream is not written and dummy values with
    adequate padding are stored in the first cross reference table,
    linearization parameter dictionary, and /Prev key of the first
    trailer dictionary.  All the offset, length, object renumbering
    information, and anything else we need for the second pass is
    stored.
   </para>
   <para>
    At the end of the first pass, this information is passed to the
    <classname>QPDF</classname> class which constructs a compressed
    hint stream in a memory buffer and returns it.
    <classname>QPDFWriter</classname> uses this information to write a
    complete hint stream object into a memory buffer.  At this point,
    the length of the hint stream is known.
   </para>
   <para>
    In the second pass, the end of the pipeline chain is a regular
    file instead of a discard pipeline, and we have known values for
    all the offsets and lengths that we didn't have in the first pass.
    We have to adjust offsets that appear after the start of the hint
    stream by the length of the hint stream, which is known.  Anything
    that is of variable length is padded, with the padding code
    surrounding any writing code that differs in the two passes.  This
    ensures that changes to the way things are represented never
    results in offsets that were gathered during the first pass
    becoming incorrect for the second pass.
   </para>
   <para>
    Using this strategy, we can write linearized files to a
    non-seekable output stream with only a single pass to disk or
    wherever the output is going.

   <title>Calculating Linearization Data</title>

    Once a file is optimized, we have information about which objects
    access which other objects.  We can then process these tables to
    decide which part (as described in &ldquo;Linearized PDF Document
    Structure&rdquo; in the PDF specification) each object is
    contained within.  This tells us the exact order in which objects
    are written.  The <classname>QPDFWriter</classname> class asks for
    this information and enqueues objects for writing in the proper
    order.  It also turns on a check that causes an exception to be
    thrown if an object is encountered that has not already been
    queued.  (This could happen only if there were a bug in the
    traversal code used to calculate the linearization data.)

    viewable with older readers.  In preserve mode, we write object
    streams such that written object streams contain the same objects
    and <literal>/Extends</literal> relationships as in the original
    file.  This is equal to disable if the file has no object streams.
    In generate, we create object streams ourselves by grouping
    objects that are allowed in object streams together in sets of no
    more than 100 objects.  We also ensure that the PDF version is at

        When available, operating system-specific secure random number
        generation is used for generating initialization vectors and
        other random values used during encryption or file creation.
        For the Windows build, this results in an added dependency on
        Microsoft's cryptography API.  To disable the OS-specific
        cryptography and use the old version, pass the

        ignored.  qpdf, per the spec, has always ignored this flag,
        but it previously did so silently.  This warning is issued
        only by the command-line tool, not by the library.  The
        library's handling of this flag is unchanged.

        Major enhancement: support has been added for newer encryption
        schemes supported by version X of Adobe Acrobat.  This
        includes use of 127-character passwords, 256-bit encryption
        keys, and the encryption scheme specified in ISO 32000-2, the
        PDF 2.0 specification.  This scheme can be chosen from the
        command line by specifying use of 256-bit keys.  qpdf also
        supports the deprecated encryption method used by Acrobat IX.
        This encryption style has known security weaknesses and should
        not be used in practice.  However, such files exist &ldquo;in
        the wild,&rdquo; so support for this scheme is still useful.
        New methods
        <function>QPDFWriter::setR6EncryptionParameters</function>
        (for the PDF 2.0 scheme) and
        <function>QPDFWriter::setR5EncryptionParameters</function>
        (for the deprecated scheme) have been added to enable these
        new encryption schemes.  Corresponding functions have been
        added to the C API as well.

        This release includes a small handful of non-compatible API
        changes.  While effort is made to avoid such changes, all the
        non-compatible API changes in this version were to parts of
        the API that would likely never be used outside the library
        itself.  In all cases, the altered methods or structures were
        parts of the <classname>QPDF</classname> that were public to
        enable them to be called from either
        <classname>QPDFWriter</classname> or were part of validation
        code that was over-zealous in reporting problems in parts of
        the file that would not ordinarily be referenced.  In no case
        did any of the removed methods do anything worse that falsely
        report error conditions in files that were broken in ways that
        didn't matter.  The following public parts of the
        <classname>QPDF</classname> class were changed in a

           Removed the method
           <function>flattenScalarReferences</function>.  This method
           was previously used prior to writing a new PDF file, but it
           has the undesired side effect of causing qpdf to read
           objects in the file that were not referenced.  Some
           otherwise files have unreferenced objects with errors in
           them, so this could cause qpdf to reject files that would
           be accepted by virtually all other PDF readers.  In fact,
           qpdf relied on only a very small part of what
           flattenScalarReferences did, so only this part has been
           preserved, and it is now done directly inside
           <classname>QPDFWriter</classname>.

           all streams in the file to be decoded, but it also suffered
           from the problem of opening otherwise unreferenced streams
           and thus could report false positive.  The
           <option>--check</option> option now causes qpdf to go
           through all the motions of writing a new file based on the
           original one, so it will always reference and check exactly
           those parts of a file that any ordinary viewer would check.

           original QPDF object by removing fields from the trailer
           dictionary that wouldn't apply to the newly written file.
           This functionality, though generally harmless, was a poor
           implementation and has been replaced by having QPDFWriter
           filter these out when copying the trailer rather than
           modifying the original QPDF object.  (Note that qpdf never
           modifies the original file itself.)

        Acknowledgment: I would like to express gratitude for the
        contributions of Tobias Hoffmann toward the release of qpdf
        version 3.0.  He is responsible for most of the implementation
        and design of the new API for manipulating pages, and
        contributed code and ideas for many of the improvements made
        in version 3.0.  Without his work, this release would
        certainly not have happened as soon as it did, if at all.

        On Windows, it is possible to build a DLL.  Additionally, a

  <para>
   Although, as a general rule, we like to avoid introducing
   source-level incompatibilities in qpdf's interface, there were a
   few non-compatible changes made in this version.  A considerable
   amount of source code that uses qpdf will probably compile without
   any changes, but in some cases, you may have to update your code.
   The changes are enumerated here.  There are also some new
   interfaces; for those, please refer to the header files.

     QPDF's exception handling mechanism now uses
     <classname>std::logic_error</classname> for internal errors and
     <classname>std::runtime_error</classname> for runtime errors in
     favor of the now removed <classname>QEXC</classname> classes used
     in previous versions.  The <classname>QEXC</classname> exception
     classes predated the addition of the
     <filename>&lt;stdexcept&gt;</filename> header file to the C++
     standard library.  Most of the exceptions thrown by the qpdf
     library itself are still of type <classname>QPDFExc</classname>
     which is now derived from
     <classname>std::runtime_error</classname>.  Programs that caught
     an instance of <classname>std::exception</classname> and
     displayed it by calling the <function>what()</function> method
     will not need to be changed.

     The <classname>QPDFExc</classname> class now internally
     represents various fields of the error condition and provides

     number of) different error conditions.  See

     useful an end-user application could do with it.  It probably
     shouldn't really be part of the public interface to begin with.

     <function>QPDF::getTrimmedUserPassword</function>.  The first one

     method used to do, which is to return the password with possible

  <title>Upgrading to 3.0</title>
  <para>
   For the most part, the API for qpdf version 3.0 is backward
   compatible with versions 2.1 and later.  There are two exceptions:
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The method
      <function>QPDFObjectHandle::replaceStreamData</function> that
      uses a <classname>StreamDataProvider</classname> to provide the
      stream data no longer takes a <varname>length</varname>
      parameter.  While it would have been easy enough to keep the
      parameter for backward compatibility, in this case, the
      parameter was removed since this provides the user an
      opportunity to simplify the calling code.  This method was
      introduced in version 2.2.  At the time, the
      <varname>length</varname> parameter was required in order to
      ensure that calls to the stream data provider returned the same
      length for a specific stream every time they were invoked.  In
      particular, the linearization code depends on this.  Instead,
      qpdf 3.0 and newer check for that constraint explicitly.  The
      first time the stream data provider is called for a specific
      stream, the actual length is saved, and subsequent calls are
      required to return the same number of bytes.  This means the
      calling code no longer has to compute the length in advance,
      which can be a significant simplification.  If your code fails
      to compile because of the extra argument and you don't want to
      make other changes to your code, just omit the argument.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Many methods take <type>long long</type> instead of other
      integer types.  Most if not all existing code should compile
      fine with this change since such parameters had always
      previously been smaller types.  This change was required to
      support files larger than two gigabytes in size.

   While version 4.0 includes a few non-compatible API changes, it is
   very unlikely that anyone's code would have used any of those parts
   of the API since they generally required information that would
   only be available inside the library.  In the unlikely event that
   you should run into trouble, please see the ChangeLog.  See also
   <xref linkend="ref.release-notes"/> for a complete list of the
   non-compatible API changes made in this version.
