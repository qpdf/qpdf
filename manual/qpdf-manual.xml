   departure from Apex, the company graciously allowed me to take
   ownership of the software and continue maintaining as an open
   source project, a decision for which I am very grateful.  I have
   made considerable enhancements to it since that time.  I feel
   fortunate to have worked for people who would make such a decision.

  <title>What is QPDF?</title>
  <para>
   QPDF is a program that does structural, content-preserving
   transformations on PDF files.  It could have been called something
   like <emphasis>pdf-to-pdf</emphasis>.  It also provides many useful
   capabilities to developers of PDF-producing software or for people
   who just want to look at the innards of a PDF file to learn more
   about how they work.
  </para>
  <para>
   With QPDF, it is possible to copy objects from one PDF file into
   another and to manipulate the list of pages in a PDF file.  This
   makes it possible to merge and split PDF files.  The QPDF library
   also makes it possible for you to create PDF files from scratch.
   In this mode, you are responsible for supplying all the contents of
   the file, while the QPDF library takes care off all the syntactical
   representation of the objects, creation of cross references tables
   and, if you use them, object streams, encryption, linearization,
   and other syntactic details.  You are still responsible for
   generating PDF content on your own.
  </para>
  <para>
   QPDF has been designed with very few external dependencies, and it
   is intentionally very lightweight.  QPDF is
   <emphasis>not</emphasis> a PDF content creation library, a PDF
   viewer, or a program capable of converting PDF into other formats.
   In particular, QPDF knows nothing about the semantics of PDF
   content streams.  If you are looking for something that can do
   that, you should look elsewhere.  However, once you have a valid
   PDF file, QPDF can be used to transform that file in ways perhaps
   your original PDF creation can't handle.  For example, many
   programs generate simple PDF files but can't password-protect them,
   web-optimize them, or perform other transformations of that type.

    Part of qpdf's test suite does comparisons of the contents PDF
    files by converting them images and comparing the images.  The
    image comparison tests are disabled by default.  Those tests are
    not required for determining correctness of a qpdf build if you
    have not modified the code since the test suite also contains
    expected output files that are compared literally.  The image
    comparison tests provide an extra check to make sure that any
    content transformations don't break the rendering of pages.
    Transformations that affect the content streams themselves are off
    by default and are only provided to help developers look into the
    contents of PDF files.  If you are making deep changes to the
    library that cause changes in the contents of the files that qpdf
    generates, then you should enable the image comparison tests.
    Enable them by running <command>configure</command> with the
    <option>--enable-test-compare-images</option> flag.  If you enable
    this, the following additional requirements are required by the
    test suite.  Note that in no case are these items required to use
    qpdf.

    Pre-built documentation is distributed with qpdf, so you should
    generally not need to rebuild the documentation.  In order to
    build the documentation from its docbook sources, you need the
    docbook XML style sheets (<ulink
    url="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/docbook/">http://downloads.sourceforge.net/docbook/</ulink>).
    To build the PDF version of the documentation, you need Apache fop
    (<ulink
    url="http://xml.apache.org/fop/">http://xml.apache.org/fop/</ulink>)
    version 0.94 or higher.

    Building qpdf on UNIX is generally just a matter of running

    <programlisting>./configure
make
</programlisting>
    You can also run <command>make check</command> to run the test
    suite and <command>make install</command> to install.  Please run
    <command>./configure --help</command> for options on what can be
    configured.  You can also set the value of
    <varname>DESTDIR</varname> during installation to install to a
    temporary location, as is common with many open source packages.
    Please see also the <filename>README.md</filename> and
    <filename>INSTALL</filename> files in the source distribution.

   <para>
    Building on Windows is a little bit more complicated.  For
    details, please see <filename>README-windows.md</filename> in the
    source distribution.  You can also download a binary distribution
    for Windows.  There is a port of qpdf to Visual C++ version 6 in
    the <filename>contrib</filename> area generously contributed by
    Jian Ma.  This is also discussed in more detail in
    <filename>README-windows.md</filename>.

   <para>
    While <type>wchar_t</type> is part of the C++ standard, qpdf uses
    it in only one place in the public API, and it's just in a helper
    function. It is possible to build qpdf on a system that doesn't
    have <type>wchar_t</type>, and it's also possible to compile a
    program that uses qpdf on a system without <type>wchar_t</type> as
    long as you don't call that one method. This is a very unusual
    situation. For a detailed discussion, please see the top-level
    README.md file in qpdf's source distribution.
   </para>
   <para>
    There are some other things you can do with the build.  Although
    qpdf uses <application>autoconf</application>, it does not use
    <application>automake</application> but instead uses a
    hand-crafted non-recursive Makefile that requires gnu make.  If
    you're really interested, please read the comments in the
    top-level <filename>Makefile</filename>.

   <title>Crypto Providers</title>
   <para>
    Starting with qpdf 9.1.0, the qpdf library can be built with
    multiple implementations of providers of cryptographic functions,
    which we refer to as &ldquo;crypto providers.&rdquo; At the time
    of writing, a crypto implementation must provide MD5 and SHA2
    (256, 384, and 512-bit) hashes and RC4 and AES256 with and without
    CBC encryption. In the future, if digital signature is added to
    qpdf, there may be additional requirements beyond this.
   </para>
   <para>
    Starting with qpdf version 9.1.0, the available implementations
    are <literal>native</literal> and <literal>gnutls</literal>. In
    qpdf 10.0.0, <literal>openssl</literal> was added. Additional
    implementations may be added if needed. It is also possible for a
    developer to provide their own implementation without modifying
    the qpdf library.

   <sect2 id="ref.crypto.build">
    <title>Build Support For Crypto Providers</title>
    <para>
     When building with qpdf's build system, crypto providers can be
     enabled at build time using various
     <command>./configure</command> options. The default behavior is
     for <command>./configure</command> to discover which crypto
     providers can be supported based on available external libraries,
     to build all available crypto providers, and to use an external
     provider as the default over the native one. This behavior can be
     changed with the following flags to
     <command>./configure</command>:

     For example, if you want to guarantee that the gnutls crypto
     provider is used and that the native provider is not built, you
     could run <command>./configure --enable-crypto-gnutls
     --disable-implicit-crypto</command>.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you build qpdf using your own build system, in order for qpdf
     to work at all, you need to enable at least one crypto provider.
     The file <filename>libqpdf/qpdf/qpdf-config.h.in</filename>
     provides macros <literal>DEFAULT_CRYPTO</literal>, whose value
     must be a string naming the default crypto provider, and various
     symbols starting with <literal>USE_CRYPTO_</literal>, at least
     one of which has to be enabled. Additionally, you must compile
     the source files that implement a crypto provider. To get a list
     of those files, look at <filename>libqpdf/build.mk</filename>. If
     you want to omit a particular crypto provider, as long as its
     <literal>USE_CRYPTO_</literal> symbol is undefined, you can
     completely ignore the source files that belong to a particular
     crypto provider. Additionally, crypto providers may have their
     own external dependencies that can be omitted if the crypto
     provider is not used. For example, if you are building qpdf
     yourself and are using an environment that does not support
     gnutls or openssl, you can ensure that
     <literal>USE_CRYPTO_NATIVE</literal> is defined,
     <literal>USE_CRYPTO_GNUTLS</literal> is not defined, and
     <literal>DEFAULT_CRYPTO</literal> is defined to
     <literal>"native"</literal>. Then you must include the source
     files used in the native implementation, some of which were added
     or renamed from earlier versions, to your build, and you can
     ignore <filename>QPDFCrypto_gnutls.cc</filename>. Always consult
     <filename>libqpdf/build.mk</filename> to get the list of source
     files you need to build.

   <sect2 id="ref.crypto.runtime">
    <title>Runtime Crypto Provider Selection</title>
    <para>
     You can use the <option>--show-crypto</option> option to
     <command>qpdf</command> to get a list of available crypto
     providers. The default provider is always listed first, and the
     rest are listed in lexical order. Each crypto provider is listed
     on a line by itself with no other text, enabling the output of

     You can override which crypto provider is used by setting the

     There are few reasons to ever do this, but you might want to do
     it if you were explicitly trying to compare behavior of two
     different crypto providers while testing performance or
     reproducing a bug. It could also be useful for people who are

    <title>Crypto Provider Design Notes</title>
    <para>
     This section describes a few bits of rationale for why the crypto
     provider interface was set up the way it was. You don't need to
     know any of this information, but it's provided for the record
     and in case it's interesting.
    </para>
    <para>
     As a general rule, I want to avoid as much as possible including
     large blocks of code that are conditionally compiled such that,
     in most builds, some code is never built. This is dangerous
     because it makes it very easy for invalid code to creep in
     unnoticed. As such, I want it to be possible to build qpdf with
     all available crypto providers, and this is the way I build qpdf
     for local development. At the same time, if a particular packager
     feels that it is a security liability for qpdf to use crypto
     functionality from other than a library that gets considerable
     scrutiny for this specific purpose (such as gnutls, openssl, or
     nettle), then I want to give that packager the ability to
     completely disable qpdf's native implementation. Or if someone
     wants to avoid adding a dependency on one of the external crypto
     providers, I don't want the availability of the provider to
     impose additional external dependencies within that environment.
     Both of these are situations that I know to be true for some
     users of qpdf.
    </para>
    <para>
     I want registration and selection of crypto providers to be
     thread-safe, and I want it to work deterministically for a
     developer to provide their own crypto provider and be able to set
     it up as the default. This was the primary motivation behind
     requiring C++-11 as doing so enabled me to exploit the guaranteed
     thread safety of local block static initialization. The
     <classname>QPDFCryptoProvider</classname> class uses a singleton
     pattern with thread-safe initialization to create the singleton
     instance of <classname>QPDFCryptoProvider</classname> and exposes
     only static methods in its public interface. In this way, if a
     developer wants to call any
     <classname>QPDFCryptoProvider</classname> methods, the library
     guarantees the <classname>QPDFCryptoProvider</classname> is fully
     initialized and all built-in crypto providers are registered.
     Making <classname>QPDFCryptoProvider</classname> actually know
     about all the built-in providers may seem a bit sad at first, but
     this choice makes it extremely clear exactly what the
     initialization behavior is. There's no question about provider
     implementations automatically registering themselves in a
     nondeterministic order. It also means that implementations do not
     need to know anything about the provider interface, which makes
     them easier to test in isolation. Another advantage of this
     approach is that a developer who wants to develop their own
     crypto provider can do so in complete isolation from the qpdf
     library and, with just two calls, can make qpdf use their
     provider in their application. If they decided to contribute
     their code, plugging it into the qpdf library would require a
     very small change to qpdf's source code.
    </para>
    <para>
     The decision to make the crypto provider selectable at runtime
     was one I struggled with a little, but I decided to do it for
     various reasons. Allowing an end user to switch crypto providers
     easily could be very useful for reproducing a potential bug. If a
     user reports a bug that some cryptographic thing is broken, I can
     easily ask that person to try with the
     <literal>QPDF_CRYPTO_PROVIDER</literal> variable set to different
     values. The same could apply in the event of a performance
     problem. This also makes it easier for qpdf's own test suite to
     exercise code with different providers without having to make
     every program that links with qpdf aware of the possibility of
     multiple providers. In qpdf's continuous integration environment,
     the entire test suite is run for each supported crypto provider.
     This is made simple by being able to select the provider using an
     environment variable.
    </para>
    <para>
     Finally, making crypto providers selectable in this way establish
     a pattern that I may follow again in the future for stream filter
     providers. One could imagine a future enhancement where someone
     could provide their own implementations for basic filters like
     <literal>/FlateDecode</literal> or for other filters that qpdf
     doesn't support. Implementing the registration functions and
     internal storage of registered providers was also easier using
     C++-11's functional interfaces, which was another reason to
     require C++-11 at this time.

      <para>
       Starting in qpdf version 9.1.1, qpdf no longer has a runtime
       dependency on perl. This is because fix-qdf was rewritten in
       C++. However, qpdf still has a build-time dependency on perl.

       Passing <option>--enable-show-failed-test-output</option> to
       <command>./configure</command> will cause any failed test
       output to be written to the console. This can be very useful
       for seeing test failures generated by autobuilders where you
       can't access qtest.log after the fact.

       If qpdf's build environment detects the presence of autoconf
       and related tools, it will check to ensure that automatically
       generated files are up-to-date with recorded checksums and fail
       if it detects a discrepancy. This feature is intended to
       prevent you from accidentally forgetting to regenerate
       automatic files after modifying their sources. If your
       packaging environment automatically refreshes automatic files,
       it can cause this check to fail. Suppress qpdf's checks by
       passing <option>--disable-check-autofiles</option> to
       <command>/.configure</command>. This is safe since qpdf's
       <command>autogen.sh</command> just runs autotools in the normal
       way.

       QPDF's <command>make install</command> does not install
       completion files by default, but as a packager, it's good if
       you install them wherever your distribution expects such files
       to go. You can find completion files to install in the
       <filename>completions</filename> directory.

  <title>Running QPDF</title>
  <para>
   This chapter describes how to run the qpdf program from the command
   line.
  </para>
  <sect1 id="ref.invocation">
   <title>Basic Invocation</title>
   <para>
    When running qpdf, the basic invocation is as follows:

    <programlisting><command>qpdf</command><option> [ <replaceable>options</replaceable> ] <replaceable>infilename</replaceable> [ <replaceable>outfilename</replaceable> ]</option>
</programlisting>
    This converts PDF file <option>infilename</option> to PDF file
    <option>outfilename</option>.  The output file is functionally
    identical to the input file but may have been structurally
    reorganized.  Also, orphaned objects will be removed from the
    file.  Many transformations are available as controlled by the
    options below.  In place of <option>infilename</option>, the
    parameter <option>--empty</option> may be specified.  This causes
    qpdf to use a dummy input file that contains zero pages.  The only
    normal use case for using <option>--empty</option> would be if you
    were going to add pages from another source, as discussed in <xref
    linkend="ref.page-selection"/>.
   </para>
   <para>
    If <option>@filename</option> appears as a word anywhere in the
    command-line, it will be read line by line, and each line will be
    treated as a command-line argument. The <option>@-</option> option
    allows arguments to be read from standard input. This allows qpdf
    to be invoked with an arbitrary number of arbitrarily long
    arguments. It is also very useful for avoiding having to pass
    passwords on the command line. Note that the
    <option>@filename</option> can't appear in the middle of an
    argument, so constructs such as <option>--arg=@option</option>
    will not work. You would have to include the argument and its
    options together in the arguments file.
   </para>
   <para>
    <option>outfilename</option> does not have to be seekable, even
    when generating linearized files.  Specifying
    &ldquo;<option>-</option>&rdquo; as <option>outfilename</option>
    means to write to standard output. If you want to overwrite the
    input file with the output, use the option
    <option>--replace-input</option> and omit the output file name.
    You can't specify the same file as both the input and the output.
    If you do this, qpdf will tell you about the
    <option>--replace-input</option> option.
   </para>
   <para>
    Most options require an output file, but some testing or
    inspection commands do not.  These are specifically noted.
   </para>
   <sect2 id="ref.exit-status">
    <title>Exit Status</title>
    <para>
     The exit status of <command>qpdf</command> may be interpreted as
     follows:
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        <literal>0</literal>: no errors or warnings were found. The
        file may still have problems qpdf can't detect. If
        <option>--warning-exit-0</option> was specified, exit status 0
        is used even if there are warnings.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        <literal>2</literal>: errors were found. qpdf was not able to
        fully process the file.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        <literal>3</literal>: qpdf encountered problems that it was
        able to recover from. In some cases, the resulting file may
        still be damaged. Note that qpdf still exits with status
        <literal>3</literal> if it finds warnings even when
        <option>--no-warn</option> is specified. With
        <option>--warning-exit-0</option>, warnings without errors
        exit with status 0 instead of 3.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
     Note that <command>qpdf</command> never exists with status
     <literal>1</literal>. If you get an exit status of
     <literal>1</literal>, it was something else, like the shell not
     being able to find or execute <command>qpdf</command>.

  <sect1 id="ref.shell-completion">
   <title>Shell Completion</title>
   <para>
    Starting in qpdf version 8.3.0, qpdf provides its own completion
    support for zsh and bash. You can enable bash completion with
    <command>eval $(qpdf --completion-bash)</command> and zsh
    completion with <command>eval $(qpdf --completion-zsh)</command>.
    If <command>qpdf</command> is not in your path, you should invoke
    it above with an absolute path. If you invoke it with a relative
    path, it will warn you, and the completion won't work if you're in
    a different directory.
   </para>
   <para>
    qpdf will use <literal>argv[0]</literal> to figure out where its
    executable is. This may produce unwanted results in some cases,
    especially if you are trying to use completion with copy of qpdf
    that is built from source. You can specify a full path to the qpdf
    you want to use for completion in the
    <literal>QPDF_EXECUTABLE</literal> environment variable.

        the password from a file or standard input, you can use

        that you can also use <option>@filename</option> or

        a file or pass it via standard input, but you would do so by
        specifying the entire

        option in the file. Syntax such as
        <option>--password=@filename</option> won't work since

        supplied password is used when opening the file. When used
        with a <option>--password</option> option, this option can be
        used to check the correctness of the password. In that case,
        an exit status of 3 means the file works with the supplied
        password. This option is mutually exclusive with
        <option>--is-encrypted</option>. Both this option and

        if one is needed to open this file.  Note that copying the
        encryption parameters from a file also copies the first half
        of <literal>/ID</literal> from the file since this is part of
        the encryption parameters.

        Both passwords will be preserved since QPDF does not
        distinguish between the two passwords.  It is possible to
        preserve encryption parameters, including the owner password,
        from a file even if you don't know the file's owner password.

      <listitem>
       <para>
        Overrides the usual computation/retrieval of the PDF file's
        encryption key from user/owner password with an explicit
        specification of the encryption key. When this option is
        specified, the argument to the <option>--password</option>
        option is interpreted as a hexadecimal-encoded key value. This
        only applies to the password used to open the main input file.
        It does not apply to other files opened by
        <option>--pages</option> or other options or to files being
        written.
       </para>
       <para>
        Most users will never have a need for this option, and no
        standard viewers support this mode of operation, but it can be
        useful for forensic or investigatory purposes. For example, if
        a PDF file is encrypted with an unknown password, a
        brute-force attack using the key directly is sometimes more
        efficient than one using the password. Also, if a file is
        heavily damaged, it may be possible to derive the encryption
        key and recover parts of the file using it directly. To expose
        the encryption key used by an encrypted file that you can open
        normally, use the <option>--show-encryption-key</option>
        option.

       <para>
        Ordinarily, qpdf attempts to automatically compensate for
        passwords specified in the wrong character encoding. This
        option suppresses that behavior. Under normal conditions,
        there are no reasons to use this option. See <xref
        linkend="ref.unicode-passwords"/> for a discussion

      <listitem>
       <para>
        This option can be used to fine-tune how qpdf interprets
        Unicode (non-ASCII) password strings passed on the command
        line. With the exception of the <option>hex-bytes</option>
        mode, these only apply to passwords provided when encrypting
        files. The <option>hex-bytes</option> mode also applies to
        passwords specified for reading files. For additional
        discussion of the supported password modes and when you might
        want to use them, see <xref linkend="ref.unicode-passwords"/>.
        The following modes are supported:
        <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
          <para>
           <option>auto</option>: Automatically determine whether the
           specified password is a properly encoded Unicode (UTF-8)
           string, and transcode it as required by the PDF spec based
           on the type encryption being applied. On Windows starting
           with version 8.4.0, and on almost all other modern
           platforms, incoming passwords will be properly encoded in
           UTF-8, so this is almost always what you want.
          </para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
          <para>
           <option>unicode</option>: Tells qpdf that the incoming
           password is UTF-8, overriding whatever its automatic
           detection determines. The only difference between this mode
           and <option>auto</option> is that qpdf will fail with an
           error message if the password is not valid UTF-8 instead of
           falling back to <option>bytes</option> mode with a warning.
          </para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
          <para>
           <option>bytes</option>: Interpret the password as a literal
           byte string. For non-Windows platforms, this is what
           versions of qpdf prior to 8.4.0 did. For Windows platforms,
           there is no way to specify strings of binary data on the
           command line directly, but you can use the
           <option>@filename</option> option to do it, in which case
           this option forces qpdf to respect the string of bytes as
           provided. This option will allow you to encrypt PDF files
           with passwords that will not be usable by other readers.
          </para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
          <para>
           <option>hex-bytes</option>: Interpret the password as a
           hex-encoded string. This provides a way to pass binary data
           as a password on all platforms including Windows. As with
           <option>bytes</option>, this option may allow creation of
           files that can't be opened by other readers. This mode
           affects qpdf's interpretation of passwords specified for
           decrypting files as well as for encrypting them. It makes
           it possible to specify strings that are encoded in some
           manner other than the system's default encoding.

      <listitem>
       <para>
        Apply rotation to specified pages. The
        <option>page-range</option> portion of the option value has
        the same format as page ranges in <xref
        linkend="ref.page-selection"/>. If the page range is omitted,
        the rotation is applied to all pages. The
        <option>angle</option> portion of the parameter may be either
        0, 90, 180, or 270. If preceded by <option>+</option> or
        <option>-</option>, the angle is added to or subtracted from
        the specified pages' original rotations. This is almost always
        what you want. Otherwise the pages' rotations are set to the
        exact value, which may cause the appearances of the pages to
        be inconsistent, especially for scans. For example, the
        command <command>qpdf in.pdf out.pdf --rotate=+90:2,4,6
        --rotate=180:7-8</command> would rotate pages 2, 4, and 6 90
        degrees clockwise from their original rotation and force the
        rotation of pages 7 through 8 to 180 degrees regardless of
        their original rotation, and the command <command>qpdf in.pdf
        out.pdf --rotate=+180</command> would rotate all pages by 180
        degrees.

        This option controls whether qpdf keeps individual files open
        while merging. Prior to version 8.1.0, qpdf always kept all
        files open, but this meant that the number of files that could
        be merged was limited by the operating system's open file
        limit. Version 8.1.0 opened files as they were referenced and
        closed them after each read, but this caused a major
        performance impact. Version 8.2.0 optimized the performance
        but did so in a way that, for local file systems, there was a
        small but unavoidable performance hit, but for networked file
        systems, the performance impact could be very high. Starting
        with version 8.2.1, the default behavior is that files are
        kept open if no more than 200 files are specified, but that
        the behavior can be explicitly overridden with the
        <option>--keep-files-open</option> flag. If you are merging
        more than 200 files but less than the operating system's max
        open files limit, you may want to use
        <option>--keep-files-open=y</option>, especially if working
        over a networked file system. If you are using a local file
        system where the overhead is low and you might sometimes merge
        more than the OS limit's number of files from a script and are
        not worried about a few seconds additional processing time,
        you may want to specify <option>--keep-files-open=n</option>.
        The threshold for switching may be changed from the default
        200 with the <option>--keep-files-open-threshold</option>
        option.

    Password-protected files may be opened by specifying a password.
    By default, qpdf will preserve any encryption data associated with
    a file.  If <option>--decrypt</option> is specified, qpdf will
    attempt to remove any encryption information.  If
    <option>--encrypt</option> is specified, qpdf will replace the
    document's encryption parameters with whatever is specified.
   </para>
   <para>
    Note that qpdf does not obey encryption restrictions already
    imposed on the file.  Doing so would be meaningless since qpdf can
    be used to remove encryption from the file entirely.  This
    functionality is not intended to be used for bypassing copyright
    restrictions or other restrictions placed on files by their
    producers.
   </para>
   <para>
    Prior to 8.4.0, in the case of passwords that contain characters
    that fall outside of 7-bit US-ASCII, qpdf left the burden of
    supplying properly encoded encryption and decryption passwords to
    the user. Starting in qpdf 8.4.0, qpdf does this automatically in
    most cases. For an in-depth discussion, please see <xref
    linkend="ref.unicode-passwords"/>. Previous versions of this
    manual described workarounds using the <command>iconv</command>
    command. Such workarounds are no longer required or recommended
    with qpdf 8.4.0. However, for backward compatibility, qpdf
    attempts to detect those workarounds and do the right thing in
    most cases.

    &ldquo;<filename>.</filename>&rdquo; can be used shortcut for the
    primary input filename.
   </para>
   <para>
    For each file that pages should be taken from, specify the file, a
    password needed to open the file (if any), and a page range.  The
    password needs to be given only once per file.  If any of the
    input files are the same as the primary input file or the file
    used to copy encryption parameters (if specified), you do not need
    to repeat the password here.  The same file can be repeated
    multiple times.  If a file that is repeated has a password, the
    password only has to be given the first time.  All non-page data
    (info, outlines, page numbers, etc.) are taken from the primary
    input file.  To discard these, use <option>--empty</option> as the
    primary input.
   </para>
   <para>
    Starting with qpdf 5.0.0, it is possible to omit the page range.
    If qpdf sees a value in the place where it expects a page range
    and that value is not a valid range but is a valid file name, qpdf
    will implicitly use the range <literal>1-z</literal>, meaning that
    it will include all pages in the file.  This makes it possible to
    easily combine all pages in a set of files with a command like
    <command>qpdf --empty out.pdf --pages *.pdf --</command>.
   </para>
   <para>
    The page range is a set of numbers separated by commas, ranges of
    numbers separated dashes, or combinations of those. The character
    &ldquo;z&rdquo; represents the last page. A number preceded by an
    &ldquo;r&rdquo; indicates to count from the end, so
    <literal>r3-r1</literal> would be the last three pages of the
    document. Pages can appear in any order. Ranges can appear with a
    high number followed by a low number, which causes the pages to
    appear in reverse. Numbers may be repeated in a page range. A page
    range may be optionally appended with <literal>:even</literal> or
    <literal>:odd</literal> to indicate only the even or odd pages in
    the given range. Note that even and odd refer to the positions
    within the specified, range, not whether the original number is
    even or odd.
   </para>

    Example page ranges:
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <literal>1,3,5-9,15-12</literal>: pages 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8,
       9, 15, 14, 13, and 12 in that order.

     <listitem>
      <para>
       <literal>5,7-9,12:odd</literal>: pages 5, 8, and, 12, which are
       the pages in odd positions from among the original range, which
       represents pages 5, 7, 8, 9, and 12.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   </para>
   <para>
    Starting in qpdf version 8.3, you can specify the
    <option>--collate</option> option. Note that this option is
    specified outside of <option>--pages&nbsp;...&nbsp;--</option>.
    When <option>--collate</option> is specified, it changes the
    meaning of <option>--pages</option> so that the specified files,
    as modified by page ranges, are collated rather than concatenated.
    For example, if you add the files <filename>odd.pdf</filename> and
    <filename>even.pdf</filename> containing odd and even pages of a
    document respectively, you could run <command>qpdf --collate
    odd.pdf --pages odd.pdf even.pdf -- all.pdf</command> to collate
    the pages. This would pick page 1 from odd, page 1 from even, page
    2 from odd, page 2 from even, etc. until all pages have been
    included. Any number of files and page ranges can be specified. If
    any file has fewer pages, that file is just skipped when its pages
    have all been included. For example, if you ran <command>qpdf
    --collate --empty --pages a.pdf 1-5 b.pdf 6-4 c.pdf r1 --
    out.pdf</command>, you would get the following pages in this
    order:
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem><para>a.pdf page 1</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>b.pdf page 6</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>c.pdf last page</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>a.pdf page 2</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>b.pdf page 5</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>a.pdf page 3</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>b.pdf page 4</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>a.pdf page 4</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>a.pdf page 5</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   </para>
   <para>
    Starting in qpdf version 10.2, you may specify a numeric argument
    to <option>--collate</option>. With
    <option>--collate=<replaceable>n</replaceable></option>, pull
    groups of <replaceable>n</replaceable> pages from each file,
    again, stopping when there are no more pages. For example, if you
    ran <command>qpdf --collate=2 --empty --pages a.pdf 1-5 b.pdf 6-4
    c.pdf r1 -- out.pdf</command>, you would get the following pages
    in this order:
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem><para>a.pdf page 1</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>a.pdf page 2</para></listitem>

    </itemizedlist>
   </para>
   <para>
    Starting in qpdf version 8.3, when you split and merge files, any
    page labels (page numbers) are preserved in the final file. It is
    expected that more document features will be preserved by
    splitting and merging. In the mean time, semantics of splitting
    and merging vary across features. For example, the document's
    outlines (bookmarks) point to actual page objects, so if you
    select some pages and not others, bookmarks that point to pages
    that are in the output file will work, and remaining bookmarks
    will not work. A future version of <command>qpdf</command> may do
    a better job at handling these issues. (Note that the qpdf library
    already contains all of the APIs required in order to implement
    this in your own application if you need it.) In the mean time,
    you can always use <option>--empty</option> as the primary input
    file to avoid copying all of that from the first file. For
    example, to take pages 1 through 5 from a
    <filename>infile.pdf</filename> while preserving all metadata
    associated with that file, you could use

    <programlisting><command>qpdf</command> <option>infile.pdf --pages . 1-5 -- outfile.pdf</option>
</programlisting>
    If you wanted pages 1 through 5 from
    <filename>infile.pdf</filename> but you wanted the rest of the
    metadata to be dropped, you could instead run

    <programlisting><command>qpdf</command> <option>--empty --pages infile.pdf 1-5 -- outfile.pdf</option>
</programlisting>
    If you wanted to take pages 1&ndash;5 from
    <filename>file1.pdf</filename> and pages 11&ndash;15 from
    <filename>file2.pdf</filename> in reverse, taking document-level
    metadata from <filename>file2.pdf</filename>, you would run

    <programlisting><command>qpdf</command> <option>file2.pdf --pages file1.pdf 1-5 . 15-11 -- outfile.pdf</option>
</programlisting>
    If, for some reason, you wanted to take the first page of an
    encrypted file called <filename>encrypted.pdf</filename> with
    password <literal>pass</literal> and repeat it twice in an output
    file, and if you wanted to drop document-level metadata but
    preserve encryption, you would use

    <programlisting><command>qpdf</command> <option>--empty --copy-encryption=encrypted.pdf --encryption-file-password=pass
--pages encrypted.pdf --password=pass 1 ./encrypted.pdf --password=pass 1 --
outfile.pdf</option>
</programlisting>
    Note that we had to specify the password all three times because
    giving a password as <option>--encryption-file-password</option>
    doesn't count for page selection, and as far as qpdf is concerned,
    <filename>encrypted.pdf</filename> and
    <filename>./encrypted.pdf</filename> are separated files.  These
    are all corner cases that most users should hopefully never have
    to be bothered with.
   </para>
   <para>
    Prior to version 8.4, it was not possible to specify the same page
    from the same file directly more than once, and the workaround of
    specifying the same file in more than one way was required.
    Version 8.4 removes this limitation, but there is still a valid
    use case. When you specify the same page from the same file more
    than once, qpdf will share objects between the pages. If you are
    going to do further manipulation on the file and need the two
    instances of the same original page to be deep copies, then you
    can specify the file in two different ways. For example
    <command>qpdf in.pdf --pages . 1 ./in.pdf 1 -- out.pdf</command>
    would create a file with two copies of the first page of the
    input, and the two copies would share any objects in common. This
    includes fonts, images, and anything else the page references.

   <title>Overlay and Underlay Options</title>
   <para>
    Starting with qpdf 8.4, it is possible to overlay or underlay
    pages from other files onto the output generated by qpdf. Specify
    overlay or underlay as follows:

    <programlisting>{ <option>--overlay</option> | <option>--underlay</option> } <replaceable>file</replaceable> [ <option>options</option> ] <option>--</option>
</programlisting>
    Overlay and underlay options are processed late, so they can be
    combined with other like merging and will apply to the final
    output. The <option>--overlay</option> and
    <option>--underlay</option> options work the same way, except
    underlay pages are drawn underneath the page to which they are
    applied, possibly obscured by the original page, and overlay files
    are drawn on top of the page to which they are applied, possibly
    obscuring the page. You can combine overlay and underlay.
   </para>
   <para>
    The default behavior of overlay and underlay is that pages are
    taken from the overlay/underlay file in sequence and applied to
    corresponding pages in the output until there are no more output
    pages. If the overlay or underlay file runs out of pages,
    remaining output pages are left alone. This behavior can be
    modified by options, which are provided between the
    <option>--overlay</option> or <option>--underlay</option> flag and
    the <option>--</option> option. The following options are
    supported:
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <option>--password=password</option>: supply a password if the
       overlay/underlay file is encrypted.

     <listitem>
      <para>
       <option>--to=page-range</option>: a range of pages in the same
       form at described in <xref linkend="ref.page-selection"/>
       indicates which pages in the output should have the
       overlay/underlay applied. If not specified, overlay/underlay
       are applied to all pages.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <option>--from=[page-range]</option>: a range of pages that
       specifies which pages in the overlay/underlay file will be used
       for overlay or underlay. If not specified, all pages will be
       used. This can be explicitly specified to be empty if
       <option>--repeat</option> is used.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <option>--repeat=page-range</option>: an optional range of
       pages that specifies which pages in the overlay/underlay file
       will be repeated after the &ldquo;from&rdquo; pages are used
       up. If you want to repeat a range of pages starting at the
       beginning, you can explicitly use <option>--from=</option>.

    Ordinarily, qpdf will attempt to recover from certain types of
    errors in PDF files.  These include errors in the cross-reference
    table, certain types of object numbering errors, and certain types
    of stream length errors.  Sometimes, qpdf may think it has
    recovered but may not have actually recovered, so care should be
    taken when using this option as some data loss is possible.  The
    <option>--suppress-recovery</option> option will prevent qpdf from
    attempting recovery.  In this case, it will fail on the first
    error that it encounters.

   <para>
    Ordinarily, qpdf reads cross-reference streams when they are
    present in a PDF file.  If <option>--ignore-xref-streams</option>
    is specified, qpdf will ignore any cross-reference streams for
    hybrid PDF files.  The purpose of hybrid files is to make some
    content available to viewers that are not aware of cross-reference
    streams.  It is almost never desirable to ignore them.  The only
    time when you might want to use this feature is if you are testing
    creation of hybrid PDF files and wish to see how a PDF consumer
    that doesn't understand object and cross-reference streams would
    interpret such a file.

        By default, streams already compressed with

        to uncompress and recompress the streams. There is a

        Tells qpdf to preserve objects that are not referenced when

        in a traversal of the document from the trailer dictionary
        will be discarded. This may be useful in working with some
        damaged files or inspecting files with known unreferenced
        objects.

        This flag is ignored for linearized files and has the effect
        of causing objects in the new file to be written in order by
        object ID from the original file. This does not mean that
        object numbers will be the same since qpdf may create stream
        lengths as direct or indirect differently from the original
        file, and the original file may have gaps in its numbering.

       <para>
        Starting with qpdf 8.1, when splitting pages, qpdf is able to
        attempt to remove images and fonts that are not used by a page
        even if they are referenced in the page's resources
        dictionary. When shared resources are in use, this behavior
        can greatly reduce the file sizes of split pages, but the
        analysis is very slow. In versions from 8.1 through 9.1.1,
        qpdf did this analysis by default. Starting in qpdf 10.0.0, if
        <literal>auto</literal> is used, qpdf does a quick analysis of
        the file to determine whether the file is likely to have
        unreferenced objects on pages, a pattern that frequently
        occurs when resource dictionaries are shared across multiple
        pages and rarely occurs otherwise. If it discovers this
        pattern, then it will attempt to remove unreferenced
        resources. Usually this means you get the slower splitting
        speed only when it's actually going to create smaller files.
        You can suppress removal of unreferenced resources altogether
        by specifying <literal>no</literal> or force it to do the full
        algorithm by specifying <literal>yes</literal>.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other than cases in which you don't care about file size and
        care a lot about runtime, there are few reasons to use this
        option, especially now that <literal>auto</literal> mode is
        supported. One reason to use this is if you suspect that qpdf
        is removing resources it shouldn't be removing. If you
        encounter that case, please report it as bug at <ulink
        url="https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf/issues/">https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf/issues/</ulink>.

        Tells qpdf to insert a newline before the

        length, after any stream content even if the last character of
        the stream was a newline. This may result in two newlines in
        some cases. This is a requirement of PDF/A. While qpdf doesn't
        specifically know how to generate PDF/A-compliant PDFs, this
        at least prevents it from removing compliance on already
        compliant files.

        linearization code. When qpdf linearizes files, it writes the
        file in two passes, using the first pass to calculate sizes
        and offsets that are required for hint tables and the
        linearization dictionary. Ordinarily, the first pass is
        discarded. This option enables it to be captured.

        When a page's contents are split across multiple streams, this
        option causes qpdf to combine them into a single stream. Use
        of this option is never necessary for ordinary usage, but it
        can help when working with some files in some cases. For
        example, this can also be combined with QDF mode or content
        normalization to make it easier to look at all of a page's
        contents at once.

      <listitem>
       <para>
        This option collapses annotations into the pages' contents
        with special handling for form fields. Ordinarily, an
        annotation is rendered separately and on top of the page.
        Combining annotations into the page's contents effectively
        freezes the placement of the annotations, making them look
        right after various page transformations. The library
        functionality backing this option was added for the benefit of
        programs that want to create <emphasis>n-up</emphasis> page
        layouts and other similar things that don't work well with
        annotations. The <replaceable>option</replaceable> parameter
        may be any of the following:
        <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
          <para>
           <option>all</option>: include all annotations that are not

         <listitem>
          <para>
           <option>print</option>: only include annotations that

       <para>
        Note that form fields are special because the annotations that
        are used to render filled-in form fields may become out of
        date from the fields' values if the form is filled in by a
        program that doesn't know how to update the appearances. If
        qpdf detects this case, its default behavior is not to flatten
        those annotations because doing so would cause the value of
        the form field to be lost. This gives you a chance to go back
        and resave the form with a program that knows how to generate
        appearances. QPDF itself can generate appearances with some
        limitations. See the <option>--generate-appearances</option>
        option below.

        If a file contains interactive form fields and indicates that
        the appearances are out of date with the values of the form,
        this flag will regenerate appearances, subject to a few
        limitations. Note that there is not usually a reason to do
        this, but it can be necessary before using the
        <option>--flatten-annotations</option> option. Most of these
        are not a problem with well-behaved PDF files. The limitations
        are as follows:
        <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
          <para>
           Radio button and checkbox appearances use the pre-set
           values in the PDF file. QPDF just makes sure that the
           correct appearance is displayed based on the value of the
           field. This is fine for PDF files that create their forms
           properly. Some PDF writers save appearances for fields when
           they change, which could cause some controls to have
           inconsistent appearances.

        Forces the PDF version of the output file to be at least
        <replaceable>version</replaceable>.  In other words, if the
        input file has a lower version than the specified version, the
        specified version will be used.  If the input file has a
        higher version, the input file's original version will be
        used.  It is seldom necessary to use this option since qpdf
        will automatically increase the version as needed when adding
        features that require newer PDF readers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The version number may be expressed in the form
        <replaceable>major.minor.extension-level</replaceable>, in
        which case the version is interpreted as
        <replaceable>major.minor</replaceable> at extension level
        <replaceable>extension-level</replaceable>.  For example,
        version <literal>1.7.8</literal> represents version 1.7 at
        extension level 8.  Note that minimal syntax checking is done
        on the command line.

       <para>
        This option forces the PDF version to be the exact version
        specified <emphasis>even when the file may have content that
        is not supported in that version</emphasis>.  The version
        number is interpreted in the same way as with
        <option>--min-version</option> so that extension levels can be
        set.  In some cases, forcing the output file's PDF version to
        be lower than that of the input file will cause qpdf to
        disable certain features of the document.  Specifically,
        256-bit keys are disabled if the version is less than 1.7 with
        extension level 8 (except R5 is disabled if less than 1.7 with
        extension level 3), AES encryption is disabled if the version
        is less than 1.6, cleartext metadata and object streams are
        disabled if less than 1.5, 128-bit encryption keys are
        disabled if less than 1.4, and all encryption is disabled if
        less than 1.3.  Even with these precautions, qpdf won't be
        able to do things like eliminate use of newer image
        compression schemes, transparency groups, or other features
        that may have been added in more recent versions of PDF.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a general rule, with the exception of big structural things
        like the use of object streams or AES encryption, PDF viewers
        are supposed to ignore features in files that they don't
        support from newer versions.  This means that forcing the
        version to a lower version may make it possible to open your
        PDF file with an older version, though bear in mind that some
        of the original document's functionality may be lost.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
   </para>
   <para>
    By default, when a stream is encoded using non-lossy filters that
    qpdf understands and is not already compressed using a good
    compression scheme, qpdf will uncompress and recompress streams.
    Assuming proper filter implements, this is safe and generally
    results in smaller files.  This behavior may also be explicitly
    requested with <option>--stream-data=compress</option>.
   </para>
   <para>
    When <option>--normalize-content=y</option> is specified, qpdf
    will attempt to normalize whitespace and newlines in page content
    streams.  This is generally safe but could, in some cases, cause
    damage to the content streams.  This option is intended for people
    who wish to study PDF content streams or to debug PDF content.
    You should not use this for &ldquo;production&rdquo; PDF files.
   </para>
   <para>
    When normalizing content, if qpdf runs into any lexical errors, it
    will print a warning indicating that content may be damaged. The
    only situation in which qpdf is known to cause damage during
    content normalization is when a page's contents are split across
    multiple streams and streams are split in the middle of a lexical
    token such as a string, name, or inline image. Note that files
    that do this are invalid since the PDF specification states that
    content streams are not to be split in the middle of a token. If
    you want to inspect the original content streams in an
    uncompressed format, you can always run with <option>--qdf
    --normalize-content=n</option> for a QDF file without content
    normalization, or alternatively
    <option>--stream-data=uncompress</option> for a regular non-QDF
    mode file with uncompressed streams. These will both uncompress
    all the streams but will not attempt to normalize content. Please
    note that if you are using content normalization or QDF mode for
    the purpose of manually inspecting files, you don't have to care
    about this.
   </para>
   <para>
    Object streams, also known as compressed objects, were introduced
    into the PDF specification at version 1.5, corresponding to
    Acrobat 6.  Some older PDF viewers may not support files with
    object streams.  qpdf can be used to transform files with object
    streams to files without object streams or vice versa.  As
    mentioned above, there are three object stream modes:
    <option>preserve</option>, <option>disable</option>, and
    <option>generate</option>.
   </para>
   <para>
    In <option>preserve</option> mode, the relationship to objects and
    the streams that contain them is preserved from the original file.
    In <option>disable</option> mode, all objects are written as
    regular, uncompressed objects.  The resulting file should be
    readable by older PDF viewers.  (Of course, the content of the
    files may include features not supported by older viewers, but at
    least the structure will be supported.)  In
    <option>generate</option> mode, qpdf will create its own object
    streams.  This will usually result in more compact PDF files,
    though they may not be readable by older viewers.  In this mode,
    qpdf will also make sure the PDF version number in the header is
    at least 1.5.
   </para>
   <para>
    The <option>--qdf</option> flag turns on QDF mode, which changes
    some of the defaults described above.  Specifically, in QDF mode,
    by default, stream data is uncompressed, content streams are
    normalized, and encryption is removed.  These defaults can still
    be overridden by specifying the appropriate options as described
    above.  Additionally, in QDF mode, stream lengths are stored as
    indirect objects, objects are laid out in a less efficient but
    more readable fashion, and the documents are interspersed with
    comments that make it easier for the user to find things and also
    make it possible for <command>fix-qdf</command> to work properly.
    QDF mode is intended for people, mostly developers, who wish to
    inspect or modify PDF files in a text editor.  For details, please
    see <xref linkend="ref.qdf"/>.

        significant parts of the content of the output PDF file. This
        means that a given qpdf operation should generate the same /ID
        each time it is run, which can be useful when caching results
        or for generation of some test data. Use of this flag is not

        qpdf will exit with a status of 2.  There are some recoverable
        conditions that <option>--check</option> detects.  These are
        issued as warnings instead of errors.  If qpdf finds no errors
        but finds warnings, it will exit with a status of 3 (as of

   <para>
    At the library API level, all methods that perform encryption and
    decryption interpret passwords as strings of bytes. It is up to
    the caller to ensure that they are appropriately encoded. Starting
    with qpdf version 8.4.0, qpdf will attempt to make this easier for
    you when interact with qpdf via its command line interface. The
    PDF specification requires passwords used to encrypt files with
    40-bit or 128-bit encryption to be encoded with PDF Doc encoding.
    This encoding is a single-byte encoding that supports ISO-Latin-1
    and a handful of other commonly used characters. It has a large
    overlap with Windows ANSI but is not exactly the same. There is
    generally not a way to provide PDF Doc encoded strings on the
    command line. As such, qpdf versions prior to 8.4.0 would often
    create PDF files that couldn't be opened with other software when
    given a password with non-ASCII characters to encrypt a file with
    40-bit or 128-bit encryption. Starting with qpdf 8.4.0, qpdf
    recognizes the encoding of the parameter and transcodes it as
    needed. The rest of this section provides the details about
    exactly how qpdf behaves. Most users will not need to know this
    information, but it might be useful if you have been working
    around qpdf's old behavior or if you are using qpdf to generate
    encrypted files for testing other PDF software.

    A note about Windows: when qpdf builds, it attempts to determine
    what it has to do to use <function>wmain</function> instead of
    <function>main</function> on Windows. The
    <function>wmain</function> function is an alternative entry point
    that receives all arguments as UTF-16-encoded strings. When qpdf
    starts up this way, it converts all the strings to UTF-8 encoding
    and then invokes the regular main. This means that, as far as qpdf
    is concerned, it receives its command-line arguments with UTF-8
    encoding, just as it would in any modern Linux or UNIX
    environment.
   </para>
   <para>
    If a file is being encrypted with 40-bit or 128-bit encryption and
    the supplied password is not a valid UTF-8 string, qpdf will fall
    back to the behavior of interpreting the password as a string of
    bytes. If you have old scripts that encrypt files by passing the
    output of <command>iconv</command> to qpdf, you no longer need to
    do that, but if you do, qpdf should still work. The only exception
    would be for the extremely unlikely case of a password that is
    encoded with a single-byte encoding but also happens to be valid
    UTF-8. Such a password would contain strings of even numbers of
    characters that alternate between accented letters and symbols. In
    the extremely unlikely event that you are intentionally using such
    passwords and qpdf is thwarting you by interpreting them as UTF-8,
    you can use <option>--password-mode=bytes</option> to suppress
    qpdf's automatic behavior.
   </para>
   <para>
    The <option>--password-mode</option> option, as described earlier
    in this chapter, can be used to change qpdf's interpretation of
    supplied passwords. There are very few reasons to use this option.
    One would be the unlikely case described in the previous paragraph
    in which the supplied password happens to be valid UTF-8 but isn't
    supposed to be UTF-8. Your best bet would be just to provide the
    password as a valid UTF-8 string, but you could also use
    <option>--password-mode=bytes</option>. Another reason to use
    <option>--password-mode=bytes</option> would be to intentionally
    generate PDF files encrypted with passwords that are not properly
    encoded. The qpdf test suite does this to generate invalid files
    for the purpose of testing its password recovery capability. If
    you were trying to create intentionally incorrect files for a
    similar purposes, the <option>bytes</option> password mode can
    enable you to do this.
   </para>
   <para>
    When qpdf attempts to decrypt a file with a password that contains
    non-ASCII characters, it will generate a list of alternative
    passwords by attempting to interpret the password as each of a
    handful of different coding systems and then transcode them to the
    required format. This helps to compensate for the supplied
    password being given in the wrong coding system, such as would
    happen if you used the <command>iconv</command> workaround that
    was previously needed. It also generates passwords by doing the
    reverse operation: translating from correct in incorrect encoding
    of the password. This would enable qpdf to decrypt files using
    passwords that were improperly encoded by whatever software
    encrypted the files, including older versions of qpdf invoked
    without properly encoded passwords. The combination of these two
    recovery methods should make qpdf transparently open most
    encrypted files with the password supplied correctly but in the
    wrong coding system. There are no real downsides to this behavior,
    but if you don't want qpdf to do this, you can use the
    <option>--suppress-password-recovery</option> option. One reason
    to do that is to ensure that you know the exact password that was
    used to encrypt the file.
   </para>
   <para>
    With these changes, qpdf now generates compliant passwords in most
    cases. There are still some exceptions. In particular, the PDF
    specification directs compliant writers to normalize Unicode
    passwords and to perform certain transformations on passwords with
    bidirectional text. Implementing this functionality requires using
    a real Unicode library like ICU. If a client application that uses
    qpdf wants to do this, the qpdf library will accept the resulting
    passwords, but qpdf will not perform these transformations itself.
    It is possible that this will be addressed in a future version of
    qpdf. The <classname>QPDFWriter</classname> methods that enable
    encryption on the output file accept passwords as strings of
    bytes.
   </para>
   <para>
    Please note that the <option>--password-is-hex-key</option> option
    is unrelated to all this. This flag bypasses the normal process of
    going from password to encryption string entirely, allowing the
    raw encryption key to be specified directly. This is useful for
    forensic purposes or for brute-force recovery of files with
    unknown passwords.

  <title>QDF Mode</title>
  <para>
   In QDF mode, qpdf creates PDF files in what we call <firstterm>QDF
   form</firstterm>.  A PDF file in QDF form, sometimes called a QDF
   file, is a completely valid PDF file that has
   <literal>%QDF-1.0</literal> as its third line (after the pdf header
   and binary characters) and has certain other characteristics.  The
   purpose of QDF form is to make it possible to edit PDF files, with
   some restrictions, in an ordinary text editor.  This can be very
   useful for experimenting with different PDF constructs or for
   making one-off edits to PDF files (though there are other reasons
   why this may not always work). Note that QDF mode does not support
   linearized files. If you enable linearization, QDF mode is
   automatically disabled.
  </para>
  <para>
   It is ordinarily very difficult to edit PDF files in a text editor
   for two reasons: most meaningful data in PDF files is compressed,
   and PDF files are full of offset and length information that makes
   it hard to add or remove data.  A QDF file is organized in a manner
   such that, if edits are kept within certain constraints, the
   <command>fix-qdf</command> program, distributed with qpdf, is able
   to restore edited files to a correct state.  The
   <command>fix-qdf</command> program takes no command-line
   arguments.  It reads a possibly edited QDF file from standard input
   and writes a repaired file to standard output.
  </para>
  <para>
   The following attributes characterize a QDF file:
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      All objects appear in numerical order in the PDF file, including
      when objects appear in object streams.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Objects are printed in an easy-to-read format, and all line
      endings are normalized to UNIX line endings.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Unless specifically overridden, streams appear uncompressed
      (when qpdf supports the filters and they are compressed with a
      non-lossy compression scheme), and most content streams are
      normalized (line endings are converted to just a UNIX-style
      linefeeds).
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      All streams lengths are represented as indirect objects, and the
      stream length object is always the next object after the stream.
      If the stream data does not end with a newline, an extra newline
      is inserted, and a special comment appears after the stream
      indicating that this has been done.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      If the PDF file contains object streams, if object stream
      <emphasis>n</emphasis> contains <emphasis>k</emphasis> objects,
      those objects are numbered from <emphasis>n+1</emphasis> through
      <emphasis>n+k</emphasis>, and the object number/offset pairs
      appear on a separate line for each object.  Additionally, each
      object in the object stream is preceded by a comment indicating
      its object number and index.  This makes it very easy to find
      objects in object streams.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      All beginnings of objects, <literal>stream</literal> tokens,
      <literal>endstream</literal> tokens, and
      <literal>endobj</literal> tokens appear on lines by themselves.
      A blank line follows every <literal>endobj</literal> token.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      If there is a cross-reference stream, it is unfiltered.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Page dictionaries and page content streams are marked with
      special comments that make them easy to find.
     </para>

  <para>
   When editing a QDF file, any edits can be made as long as the above
   constraints are maintained.  This means that you can freely edit a
   page's content without worrying about messing up the QDF file.  It
   is also possible to add new objects so long as those objects are
   added after the last object in the file or subsequent objects are
   renumbered.  If a QDF file has object streams in it, you can always
   add the new objects before the xref stream and then change the
   number of the xref stream, since nothing generally ever references
   it by number.
  </para>
  <para>
   It is not generally practical to remove objects from QDF files
   without messing up object numbering, but if you remove all
   references to an object, you can run qpdf on the file (after
   running <command>fix-qdf</command>), and qpdf will omit the
   now-orphaned object.

   When <command>fix-qdf</command> is run, it goes through the file
   and recomputes the following parts of the file:

   <title>A Note About Unicode File Names</title>
   <para>
    When strings are passed to qpdf library routines either as
    <literal>char*</literal> or as <literal>std::string</literal>,
    they are treated as byte arrays except where otherwise noted. When
    Unicode is desired, qpdf wants UTF-8 unless otherwise noted in
    comments in header files. In modern UNIX/Linux environments, this
    generally does the right thing. In Windows, it's a bit more
    complicated. Starting in qpdf 8.4.0, passwords that contain
    Unicode characters are handled much better, and starting in qpdf
    8.4.1, the library attempts to properly handle Unicode characters
    in filenames. In particular, in Windows, if a UTF-8 encoded string
    is used as a filename in either <classname>QPDF</classname> or
    <classname>QPDFWriter</classname>, it is internally converted to
    <literal>wchar_t*</literal>, and Unicode-aware Windows APIs are
    used. As such, qpdf will generally operate properly on files with
    non-ASCII characters in their names as long as the filenames are
    UTF-8 encoded for passing into the qpdf library API, but there are
    still some rough edges, such as the encoding of the filenames in
    error messages our CLI output messages. Patches or bug reports are
    welcome for any continuing issues with Unicode file names in

        The top-level JSON object output is a dictionary. The JSON
        output contains various nested dictionaries and arrays. With
        the exception of dictionaries that are populated by the fields
        of objects from the file, all instances of a dictionary are
        guaranteed to have exactly the same keys. Future versions of
        qpdf are free to add additional keys but not to remove keys or
        change the type of object that a key points to. The qpdf
        program validates this guarantee, and in the unlikely event
        that a bug in qpdf should cause it to generate data that
        doesn't conform to this rule, it will ask you to file a bug

        of a key, a change to the format of data pointed to by a key,

   <title>Limitations of JSON Representation</title>
   <para>
    There are a few limitations to be aware of with the JSON structure:
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Strings, names, and indirect object references in the original
       PDF file are all converted to strings in the JSON
       representation. In the case of a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; PDF file,
       you can tell the difference because a name starts with a slash
       (<literal>/</literal>), and an indirect object reference looks
       like <literal>n n R</literal>, but if there were to be a string
       that looked like a name or indirect object reference, there
       would be no way to tell this from the JSON output. Note that
       there are certain cases where you know for sure what something
       is, such as knowing that dictionary keys in objects are always
       names and that certain things in the higher-level computed data
       are known to contain indirect object references.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       The JSON format doesn't support binary data very well. Mostly
       the details are not important, but they are presented here for
       information. When qpdf outputs a string in the JSON
       representation, it converts the string to UTF-8, assuming usual
       PDF string semantics. Specifically, if the original string is
       UTF-16, it is converted to UTF-8. Otherwise, it is assumed to
       have PDF doc encoding, and is converted to UTF-8 with that
       assumption. This causes strange things to happen to binary
       strings. For example, if you had the binary string
       <literal>&lt;038051&gt;</literal>, this would be output to the
       JSON as <literal>\u0003•Q</literal> because
       <literal>03</literal> is not a printable character and
       <literal>80</literal> is the bullet character in PDF doc
       encoding and is mapped to the Unicode value
       <literal>2022</literal>. Since <literal>51</literal> is
       <literal>Q</literal>, it is output as is. If you wanted to
       convert back from here to a binary string, would have to
       recognize Unicode values whose code points are higher than
       <literal>0xFF</literal> and map those back to their
       corresponding PDF doc encoding characters. There is no way to
       tell the difference between a Unicode string that was originally
       encoded as UTF-16 or one that was converted from PDF doc
       encoding. In other words, it's best if you don't try to use the
       JSON format to extract binary strings from the PDF file, but if
       you really had to, it could be done. Note that qpdf's
       <option>--show-object</option> option does not have this
       limitation and will reveal the string as encoded in the original
       file.

    For the most part, the built-in JSON help tells you everything you
    need to know about the JSON format, but there are a few
    non-obvious things to be aware of:

       While qpdf guarantees that keys present in the help will be
       present in the output, those fields may be null or empty if the
       information is not known or absent in the file. Also, if you
       specify <option>--json-keys</option>, the keys that are not
       listed will be excluded entirely except for those that
       <option>--json-help</option> says are always present.

      <para>
       In a few places, there are keys with names containing
       <literal>pageposfrom1</literal>. The values of these keys are
       null or an integer. If an integer, they point to a page index
       within the file numbering from 1. Note that JSON indexes from
       0, and you would also use 0-based indexing using the API.
       However, 1-based indexing is easier in this case because the
       command-line syntax for specifying page ranges is 1-based. If
       you were going to write a program that looked through the JSON
       for information about specific pages and then use the
       command-line to extract those pages, 1-based indexing is
       easier. Besides, it's more convenient to subtract 1 from a
       program in a real programming language than it is to add 1 from
       shell code.

    This section was written prior to the implementation of the qpdf
    package and was subsequently modified to reflect the
    implementation.  In some cases, for purposes of explanation, it
    may differ slightly from the actual implementation.  As always,
    the source code and test suite are authoritative.  Even if there
    are some errors, this document should serve as a road map to
    understanding how this code works.
   </para>
   <para>
    In general, one should adhere strictly to a specification when
    writing but be liberal in reading. This way, the product of our
    software will be accepted by the widest range of other programs,
    and we will accept the widest range of input files. This library
    attempts to conform to that philosophy whenever possible but also
    aims to provide strict checking for people who want to validate
    PDF files. If you don't want to see warnings and are trying to
    write something that is tolerant, you can call
    <literal>setSuppressWarnings(true)</literal>. If you want to fail
    on the first error, you can call
    <literal>setAttemptRecovery(false)</literal>. The default behavior
    is to generating warnings for recoverable problems. Note that
    recovery will not always produce the desired results even if it is
    able to get through the file. Unlike most other PDF files that
    produce generic warnings such as &ldquo;This file is
    damaged,&rdquo;, qpdf generally issues a detailed error message
    that would be most useful to a PDF developer. This is by design as
    there seems to be a shortage of PDF validation tools out there.
    This was, in fact, one of the major motivations behind the initial
    creation of qpdf.

   <para>
    The QPDF package includes support for reading and rewriting PDF
    files. It aims to hide from the user details involving object
    locations, modified (appended) PDF files, the
    directness/indirectness of objects, and stream filters including
    encryption. It does not aim to hide knowledge of the object
    hierarchy or content stream contents. Put another way, a user of
    the qpdf library is expected to have knowledge about how PDF files
    work, but is not expected to have to keep track of bookkeeping
    details such as file positions.
   </para>
   <para>
    A user of the library never has to care whether an object is
    direct or indirect, though it is possible to determine whether an
    object is direct or not if this information is needed. All access
    to objects deals with this transparently. All memory management
    details are also handled by the library.
   </para>
   <para>
    The <classname>PointerHolder</classname> object is used internally
    by the library to deal with memory management. This is basically a
    smart pointer object very similar in spirit to C++-11's
    <classname>std::shared_ptr</classname> object, but predating it by
    several years. This library also makes use of a technique for
    giving fine-grained access to methods in one class to other
    classes by using public subclasses with friends and only private
    members that in turn call private methods of the containing class.
    See <classname>QPDFObjectHandle::Factory</classname> as an
    example.
   </para>
   <para>
    The top-level qpdf class is <classname>QPDF</classname>.  A
    <classname>QPDF</classname> object represents a PDF file.  The
    library provides methods for both accessing and mutating PDF
    files.
   </para>
   <para>
    The primary class for interacting with PDF objects is
    <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname>. Instances of this class
    can be passed around by value, copied, stored in containers, etc.
    with very low overhead. Instances of
    <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname> created by reading from a
    file will always contain a reference back to the
    <classname>QPDF</classname> object from which they were created. A
    <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname> may be direct or indirect.
    If indirect, the <classname>QPDFObject</classname> the
    <classname>PointerHolder</classname> initially points to is a null
    pointer. In this case, the first attempt to access the underlying
    <classname>QPDFObject</classname> will result in the
    <classname>QPDFObject</classname> being resolved via a call to the
    referenced <classname>QPDF</classname> instance. This makes it
    essentially impossible to make coding errors in which certain
    things will work for some PDF files and not for others based on
    which objects are direct and which objects are indirect.
   </para>
   <para>
    Instances of <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname> can be
    directly created and modified using static factory methods in the
    <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname> class. There are factory
    methods for each type of object as well as a convenience method
    <function>QPDFObjectHandle::parse</function> that creates an
    object from a string representation of the object.  Existing
    instances of <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname> can also be
    modified in several ways.  See comments in
    <filename>QPDFObjectHandle.hh</filename> for details.
   </para>
   <para>
    An instance of <classname>QPDF</classname> is constructed by using
    the class's default constructor.  If desired, the
    <classname>QPDF</classname> object may be configured with various
    methods that change its default behavior.  Then the
    <function>QPDF::processFile()</function> method is passed the name
    of a PDF file, which permanently associates the file with that
    QPDF object.  A password may also be given for access to
    password-protected files.  QPDF does not enforce encryption
    parameters and will treat user and owner passwords equivalently.
    Either password may be used to access an encrypted file.
    <footnote>
     <para>
      As pointed out earlier, the intention is not for qpdf to be used
      to bypass security on files. but as any open source PDF consumer
      may be easily modified to bypass basic PDF document security,
      and qpdf offers may transformations that can do this as well,
      there seems to be little point in the added complexity of
      conditionally enforcing document security.
     </para>
    </footnote>
    <classname>QPDF</classname> will allow recovery of a user password
    given an owner password.  The input PDF file must be seekable.
    (Output files written by <classname>QPDFWriter</classname> need
    not be seekable, even when creating linearized files.)  During
    construction, <classname>QPDF</classname> validates the PDF file's
    header, and then reads the cross reference tables and trailer
    dictionaries.  The <classname>QPDF</classname> class keeps only
    the first trailer dictionary though it does read all of them so it
    can check the <literal>/Prev</literal> key.
    <classname>QPDF</classname> class users may request the root
    object and the trailer dictionary specifically.  The cross
    reference table is kept private.  Objects may then be requested by
    number of by walking the object tree.
   </para>
   <para>
    When a PDF file has a cross-reference stream instead of a
    cross-reference table and trailer, requesting the document's
    trailer dictionary returns the stream dictionary from the
    cross-reference stream instead.
   </para>
   <para>
    There are some convenience routines for very common operations
    such as walking the page tree and returning a vector of all page
    objects. For full details, please see the header files
    <filename>QPDF.hh</filename> and
    <filename>QPDFObjectHandle.hh</filename>. There are also some
    additional helper classes that provide higher level API functions
    for certain document constructions. These are discussed in <xref
    linkend="ref.helper-classes"/>.
   </para>

  <sect1 id="ref.helper-classes">
   <title>Helper Classes</title>
   <para>
    QPDF version 8.1 introduced the concept of helper classes. Helper
    classes are intended to contain higher level APIs that allow
    developers to work with certain document constructs at an
    abstraction level above that of
    <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname> while staying true to
    qpdf's philosophy of not hiding document structure from the
    developer. As with qpdf in general, the goal is take away some of
    the more tedious bookkeeping aspects of working with PDF files,
    not to remove the need for the developer to understand how the PDF
    construction in question works. The driving factor behind the
    creation of helper classes was to allow the evolution of higher
    level interfaces in qpdf without polluting the interfaces of the
    main top-level classes <classname>QPDF</classname> and
    <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname>.
   </para>
   <para>
    There are two kinds of helper classes:
    <emphasis>document</emphasis> helpers and
    <emphasis>object</emphasis> helpers. Document helpers are
    constructed with a reference to a <classname>QPDF</classname>
    object and provide methods for working with structures that are at
    the document level. Object helpers are constructed with an
    instance of a <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname> and provide
    methods for working with specific types of objects.
   </para>
   <para>
    Examples of document helpers include
    <classname>QPDFPageDocumentHelper</classname>, which contains
    methods for operating on the document's page trees, such as
    enumerating all pages of a document and adding and removing pages;
    and <classname>QPDFAcroFormDocumentHelper</classname>, which
    contains document-level methods related to interactive forms, such
    as enumerating form fields and creating mappings between form
    fields and annotations.
   </para>
   <para>
    Examples of object helpers include
    <classname>QPDFPageObjectHelper</classname> for performing
    operations on pages such as page rotation and some operations on
    content streams, <classname>QPDFFormFieldObjectHelper</classname>
    for performing operations related to interactive form fields, and
    <classname>QPDFAnnotationObjectHelper</classname> for working with
    annotations.
   </para>
   <para>
    It is always possible to retrieve the underlying
    <classname>QPDF</classname> reference from a document helper and
    the underlying <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname> reference
    from an object helper. Helpers are designed to be helpers, not
    wrappers. The intention is that, in general, it is safe to freely
    intermix operations that use helpers with operations that use the
    underlying objects. Document and object helpers do not attempt to
    provide a complete interface for working with the things they are
    helping with, nor do they attempt to encapsulate underlying
    structures. They just provide a few methods to help with
    error-prone, repetitive, or complex tasks. In some cases, a helper
    object may cache some information that is expensive to gather. In
    such cases, the helper classes are implemented so that their own
    methods keep the cache consistent, and the header file will
    provide a method to invalidate the cache and a description of what
    kinds of operations would make the cache invalid. If in doubt, you
    can always discard a helper class and create a new one with the
    same underlying objects, which will ensure that you have discarded
    any stale information.
   </para>
   <para>
    By Convention, document helpers are called
    <classname>QPDFSomethingDocumentHelper</classname> and are derived
    from <classname>QPDFDocumentHelper</classname>, and object helpers
    are called <classname>QPDFSomethingObjectHelper</classname> and
    are derived from <classname>QPDFObjectHelper</classname>. For
    details on specific helpers, please see their header files. You
    can find them by looking at
    <filename>include/qpdf/QPDF*DocumentHelper.hh</filename> and
    <filename>include/qpdf/QPDF*ObjectHelper.hh</filename>.
   </para>
   <para>
    In order to avoid creation of circular dependencies, the following
    general guidelines are followed with helper classes:
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Core class interfaces do not know about helper classes. For
       example, no methods of <classname>QPDF</classname> or
       <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname> will include helper
       classes in their interfaces.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Interfaces of object helpers will usually not use document
       helpers in their interfaces. This is because it is much more
       useful for document helpers to have methods that return object
       helpers. Most operations in PDF files start at the document
       level and go from there to the object level rather than the
       other way around. It can sometimes be useful to map back from
       object-level structures to document-level structures. If there
       is a desire to do this, it will generally be provided by a
       method in the document helper class.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Most of the time, object helpers don't know about other object
       helpers. However, in some cases, one type of object may be a
       container for another type of object, in which case it may make
       sense for the outer object to know about the inner object. For
       example, there are methods in the
       <classname>QPDFPageObjectHelper</classname> that know
       <classname>QPDFAnnotationObjectHelper</classname> because
       references to annotations are contained in page dictionaries.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Any helper or core library class may use helpers in their
       implementations.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   </para>
   <para>
    Prior to qpdf version 8.1, higher level interfaces were added as
    &ldquo;convenience functions&rdquo; in either
    <classname>QPDF</classname> or
    <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname>. For compatibility, older
    convenience functions for operating with pages will remain in
    those classes even as alternatives are provided in helper classes.
    Going forward, new higher level interfaces will be provided using
    helper classes.

   <title>Implementation Notes</title>
   <para>
    This section contains a few notes about QPDF's internal
    implementation, particularly around what it does when it first
    processes a file. This section is a bit of a simplification of
    what it actually does, but it could serve as a starting point to
    someone trying to understand the implementation. There is nothing
    in this section that you need to know to use the qpdf library.
   </para>
   <para>
    <classname>QPDFObject</classname> is the basic PDF Object class.
    It is an abstract base class from which are derived classes for
    each type of PDF object.  Clients do not interact with Objects
    directly but instead interact with
    <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname>.
   </para>
   <para>
    When the <classname>QPDF</classname> class creates a new object,
    it dynamically allocates the appropriate type of
    <classname>QPDFObject</classname> and immediately hands the
    pointer to an instance of <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname>.
    The parser reads a token from the current file position. If the
    token is a not either a dictionary or array opener, an object is
    immediately constructed from the single token and the parser
    returns. Otherwise, the parser iterates in a special mode in which
    it accumulates objects until it finds a balancing closer. During
    this process, the &ldquo;<literal>R</literal>&rdquo; keyword is
    recognized and an indirect <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname>
    may be constructed.
   </para>
   <para>
    The <function>QPDF::resolve()</function> method, which is used to
    resolve an indirect object, may be invoked from the
    <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname> class.  It first checks a
    cache to see whether this object has already been read.  If not,
    it reads the object from the PDF file and caches it.  It the
    returns the resulting <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname>.
    The calling object handle then replaces its
    <classname>PointerHolder&lt;QDFObject&gt;</classname> with the one
    from the newly returned <classname>QPDFObjectHandle</classname>.
    In this way, only a single copy of any direct object need exist
    and clients can access objects transparently without knowing
    caring whether they are direct or indirect objects.  Additionally,
    no object is ever read from the file more than once.  That means
    that only the portions of the PDF file that are actually needed
    are ever read from the input file, thus allowing the qpdf package
    to take advantage of this important design goal of PDF files.
   </para>
   <para>
    If the requested object is inside of an object stream, the object
    stream itself is first read into memory.  Then the tokenizer reads
    objects from the memory stream based on the offset information
    stored in the stream.  Those individual objects are cached, after
    which the temporary buffer holding the object stream contents are
    discarded.  In this way, the first time an object in an object
    stream is requested, all objects in the stream are cached.

   <title>Casting Policy</title>
   <para>
    This section describes the casting policy followed by qpdf's
    implementation.  This is no concern to qpdf's end users and
    largely of no concern to people writing code that uses qpdf, but
    it could be of interest to people who are porting qpdf to a new
    platform or who are making modifications to the code.
   </para>
   <para>
    The C++ code in qpdf is free of old-style casts except where
    unavoidable (e.g. where the old-style cast is in a macro provided
    by a third-party header file).  When there is a need for a cast,
    it is handled, in order of preference, by rewriting the code to
    avoid the need for a cast, calling
    <function>const_cast</function>, calling
    <function>static_cast</function>, calling
    <function>reinterpret_cast</function>, or calling some combination
    of the above.  As a last resort, a compiler-specific
    <literal>#pragma</literal> may be used to suppress a warning that
    we don't want to fix.  Examples may include suppressing warnings
    about the use of old-style casts in code that is shared between C
    and C++ code.

   <para>
    The <classname>QIntC</classname> namespace, provided by
    <filename>include/qpdf/QIntC.hh</filename>, implements safe
    functions for converting between integer types. These functions do
    range checking and throw a <type>std::range_error</type>, which is
    subclass of <type>std::runtime_error</type>, if conversion from one
    integer type to another results in loss of information. There are
    many cases in which we have to move between different integer
    types because of incompatible integer types used in interoperable
    interfaces. Some are unavoidable, such as moving between sizes and
    offsets, and others are there because of old code that is too in
    entrenched to be fixable without breaking source compatibility and
    causing pain for users. QPDF is compiled with extra warnings to
    detect conversions with potential data loss, and all such cases
    should be fixed by either using a function from
    <classname>QIntC</classname> or a
    <function>static_cast</function>.
   </para>
   <para>
    When the intention is just to switch the type because of
    exchanging data between incompatible interfaces, use
    <classname>QIntC</classname>. This is the usual case. However,
    there are some cases in which we are explicitly intending to use
    the exact same bit pattern with a different type. This is most
    common when switching between signed and unsigned characters. A
    lot of qpdf's code uses unsigned characters internally, but
    <type>std::string</type> and <type>char</type> are signed. Using
    <function>QIntC::to_char</function> would be wrong for converting
    from unsigned to signed characters because a negative
    <type>char</type> value and the corresponding <type>unsigned
    char</type> value greater than 127 <emphasis>mean the same
    thing</emphasis>. There are also cases in which we use
    <function>static_cast</function> when working with bit fields
    where we are not representing a numerical value but rather a bunch
    of bits packed together in some integer type. Also note that
    <type>size_t</type> and <type>long</type> both typically differ
    between 32-bit and 64-bit environments, so sometimes an explicit
    cast may not be needed to avoid warnings on one platform but may
    be needed on another. A conversion with
    <classname>QIntC</classname> should always be used when the types
    are different even if the underlying size is the same. QPDF's CI
    build builds on 32-bit and 64-bit platforms, and the test suite is
    very thorough, so it is hard to make any of the potential errors
    here without being caught in build or test.

   <para>
    Non-const <type>unsigned char*</type> is used in the
    <type>Pipeline</type> interface. The pipeline interface has a
    <function>write</function> call that uses <type>unsigned
    char*</type> without a <type>const</type> qualifier. The main
    reason for this is to support pipelines that make calls to
    third-party libraries, such as zlib, that don't include
    <type>const</type> in their interfaces. Unfortunately, there are
    many places in the code where it is desirable to have <type>const
    char*</type> with pipelines. None of the pipeline implementations
    in qpdf currently modify the data passed to write, and doing so
    would be counter to the intent of <type>Pipeline</type>, but there
    is nothing in the code to prevent this from being done. There are
    places in the code where <function>const_cast</function> is used
    to remove the const-ness of pointers going into
    <type>Pipeline</type>s. This could theoretically be unsafe, but
    there is adequate testing to assert that it is safe and will
    remain safe in qpdf's code.

   <title>Encryption</title>
   <para>
    Encryption is supported transparently by qpdf.  When opening a PDF
    file, if an encryption dictionary exists, the
    <classname>QPDF</classname> object processes this dictionary using
    the password (if any) provided.  The primary decryption key is
    computed and cached.  No further access is made to the encryption
    dictionary after that time.  When an object is read from a file,
    the object ID and generation of the object in which it is
    contained is always known.  Using this information along with the
    stored encryption key, all stream and string objects are
    transparently decrypted.  Raw encrypted objects are never stored
    in memory.  This way, nothing in the library ever has to know or
    care whether it is reading an encrypted file.
   </para>
   <para>
    An interface is also provided for writing encrypted streams and
    strings given an encryption key.  This is used by
    <classname>QPDFWriter</classname> when it rewrites encrypted
    files.
   </para>
   <para>
    When copying encrypted files, unless otherwise directed, qpdf will
    preserve any encryption in force in the original file.  qpdf can
    do this with either the user or the owner password.  There is no
    difference in capability based on which password is used.  When 40
    or 128 bit encryption keys are used, the user password can be
    recovered with the owner password.  With 256 keys, the user and
    owner passwords are used independently to encrypt the actual
    encryption key, so while either can be used, the owner password
    can no longer be used to recover the user password.
   </para>
   <para>
    Starting with version 4.0.0, qpdf can read files that are not
    encrypted but that contain encrypted attachments, but it cannot
    write such files.  qpdf also requires the password to be specified
    in order to open the file, not just to extract attachments, since
    once the file is open, all decryption is handled transparently.
    When copying files like this while preserving encryption, qpdf
    will apply the file's encryption to everything in the file, not
    just to the attachments.  When decrypting the file, qpdf will
    decrypt the attachments.  In general, when copying PDF files with
    multiple encryption formats, qpdf will choose the newest format.
    The only exception to this is that clear-text metadata will be
    preserved as clear-text if it is that way in the original file.
   </para>
   <para>
    One point of confusion some people have about encrypted PDF files
    is that encryption is not the same as password protection.
    Password protected files are always encrypted, but it is also
    possible to create encrypted files that do not have passwords.
    Internally, such files use the empty string as a password, and
    most readers try the empty string first to see if it works and
    prompt for a password only if the empty string doesn't work.
    Normally such files have an empty user password and a non-empty
    owner password. In that way, if the file is opened by an ordinary
    reader without specification of password, the restrictions
    specified in the encryption dictionary can be enforced. Most users
    wouldn't even realize such a file was encrypted. Since qpdf always
    ignores the restrictions (except for the purpose of reporting what
    they are), qpdf doesn't care which password you use. QPDF will
    allow you to create PDF files with non-empty user passwords and
    empty owner passwords. Some readers will require a password when
    you open these files, and others will open the files without a
    password and not enforce restrictions. Having a non-empty user
    password and an empty owner password doesn't really make sense
    because it would mean that opening the file with the user password
    would be more restrictive than not supplying a password at all.
    QPDF also allows you to create PDF files with the same password as
    both the user and owner password. Some readers will not ever allow
    such files to be accessed without restrictions because they never
    try the password as the owner password if it works as the user
    password. Nonetheless, one of the powerful aspects of qpdf is that
    it allows you to finely specify the way encrypted files are
    created, even if the results are not useful to some readers. One
    use case for this would be for testing a PDF reader to ensure that
    it handles odd configurations of input files.

   <title>Random Number Generation</title>
   <para>
    QPDF generates random numbers to support generation of encrypted
    data. Starting in qpdf 10.0.0, qpdf uses the crypto provider as
    its source of random numbers. Older versions used the OS-provided
    source of secure random numbers or, if allowed at build time,
    insecure random numbers from stdlib. Starting with version 5.1.0,
    you can disable use of OS-provided secure random numbers at build
    time. This is especially useful on Windows if you want to avoid a
    dependency on Microsoft's cryptography API. You can also supply
    your own random data provider. For details on how to do this,

   <title>Adding and Removing Pages</title>
   <para>
    While qpdf's API has supported adding and modifying objects for
    some time, version 3.0 introduces specific methods for adding and
    removing pages.  These are largely convenience routines that
    handle two tricky issues: pushing inheritable resources from the
    <literal>/Pages</literal> tree down to individual pages and
    manipulation of the <literal>/Pages</literal> tree itself.  For

  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="ref.reserved-objects">
   <title>Reserving Object Numbers</title>
   <para>
    Version 3.0 of qpdf introduced the concept of reserved objects.
    These are seldom needed for ordinary operations, but there are
    cases in which you may want to add a series of indirect objects
    with references to each other to a <classname>QPDF</classname>
    object.  This causes a problem because you can't determine the
    object ID that a new indirect object will have until you add it to
    the <classname>QPDF</classname> object with
    <function>QPDF::makeIndirectObject</function>.  The only way to
    add two mutually referential objects to a
    <classname>QPDF</classname> object prior to version 3.0 would be
    to add the new objects first and then make them refer to each
    other after adding them.  Now it is possible to create a
    <firstterm>reserved object</firstterm> using
    <function>QPDFObjectHandle::newReserved</function>.  This is an
    indirect object that stays &ldquo;unresolved&rdquo; even if it is
    queried for its type.  So now, if you want to create a set of
    mutually referential objects, you can create reservations for each
    one of them and use those reservations to construct the
    references.  When finished, you can call
    <function>QPDF::replaceReserved</function> to replace the reserved
    objects with the real ones.  This functionality will never be
    needed by most applications, but it is used internally by QPDF
    when copying objects from other PDF files, as discussed in <xref
    linkend="ref.foreign-objects"/>.  For an example of how to use
    reserved objects, search for <function>newReserved</function> in
    <filename>test_driver.cc</filename> in qpdf's sources.

  <sect1 id="ref.foreign-objects">
   <title>Copying Objects From Other PDF Files</title>
   <para>
    Version 3.0 of qpdf introduced the ability to copy objects into a
    <classname>QPDF</classname> object from a different
    <classname>QPDF</classname> object, which we refer to as
    <firstterm>foreign objects</firstterm>. This allows arbitrary
    merging of PDF files. The &ldquo;from&rdquo;
    <classname>QPDF</classname> object must remain valid after the
    copy as discussed in the note below. The <command>qpdf</command>
    command-line tool provides limited support for basic page
    selection, including merging in pages from other files, but the
    library's API makes it possible to implement arbitrarily complex
    merging operations. The main method for copying foreign objects is
    <function>QPDF::copyForeignObject</function>. This takes an
    indirect object from another <classname>QPDF</classname> and
    copies it recursively into this object while preserving all object
    structure, including circular references. This means you can add a
    direct object that you create from scratch to a
    <classname>QPDF</classname> object with
    <function>QPDF::makeIndirectObject</function>, and you can add an
    indirect object from another file with
    <function>QPDF::copyForeignObject</function>. The fact that
    <function>QPDF::makeIndirectObject</function> does not
    automatically detect a foreign object and copy it is an explicit
    design decision. Copying a foreign object seems like a
    sufficiently significant thing to do that it should be done
    explicitly.
   </para>
   <para>
    The other way to copy foreign objects is by passing a page from
    one <classname>QPDF</classname> to another by calling
    <function>QPDF::addPage</function>.  In contrast to
    <function>QPDF::makeIndirectObject</function>, this method
    automatically distinguishes between indirect objects in the
    current file, foreign objects, and direct objects.
   </para>
   <para>
    Please note: when you copy objects from one
    <classname>QPDF</classname> to another, the source
    <classname>QPDF</classname> object must remain valid until you
    have finished with the destination object. This is because the
    original object is still used to retrieve any referenced stream
    data from the copied object.

   <title>Writing Linearized Files</title>
   <para>
    We will create files with only primary hint streams.  We will
    never write overflow hint streams.  (As of PDF version 1.4,
    Acrobat doesn't either, and they are never necessary.)  The hint
    streams contain offset information to objects that point to where
    they would be if the hint stream were not present.  This means
    that we have to calculate all object positions before we can
    generate and write the hint table.  This means that we have to
    generate the file in two passes.  To make this reliable,
    <classname>QPDFWriter</classname> in linearization mode invokes
    exactly the same code twice to write the file to a pipeline.
   </para>
   <para>
    In the first pass, the target pipeline is a count pipeline chained
    to a discard pipeline.  The count pipeline simply passes its data
    through to the next pipeline in the chain but can return the
    number of bytes passed through it at any intermediate point.  The
    discard pipeline is an end of line pipeline that just throws its
    data away.  The hint stream is not written and dummy values with
    adequate padding are stored in the first cross reference table,
    linearization parameter dictionary, and /Prev key of the first
    trailer dictionary.  All the offset, length, object renumbering
    information, and anything else we need for the second pass is
    stored.
   </para>
   <para>
    At the end of the first pass, this information is passed to the
    <classname>QPDF</classname> class which constructs a compressed
    hint stream in a memory buffer and returns it.
    <classname>QPDFWriter</classname> uses this information to write a
    complete hint stream object into a memory buffer.  At this point,
    the length of the hint stream is known.
   </para>
   <para>
    In the second pass, the end of the pipeline chain is a regular
    file instead of a discard pipeline, and we have known values for
    all the offsets and lengths that we didn't have in the first pass.
    We have to adjust offsets that appear after the start of the hint
    stream by the length of the hint stream, which is known.  Anything
    that is of variable length is padded, with the padding code
    surrounding any writing code that differs in the two passes.  This
    ensures that changes to the way things are represented never
    results in offsets that were gathered during the first pass
    becoming incorrect for the second pass.
   </para>
   <para>
    Using this strategy, we can write linearized files to a
    non-seekable output stream with only a single pass to disk or
    wherever the output is going.

   <title>Calculating Linearization Data</title>
   <para>
    Once a file is optimized, we have information about which objects
    access which other objects.  We can then process these tables to
    decide which part (as described in &ldquo;Linearized PDF Document
    Structure&rdquo; in the PDF specification) each object is
    contained within.  This tells us the exact order in which objects
    are written.  The <classname>QPDFWriter</classname> class asks for
    this information and enqueues objects for writing in the proper
    order.  It also turns on a check that causes an exception to be
    thrown if an object is encountered that has not already been
    queued.  (This could happen only if there were a bug in the
    traversal code used to calculate the linearization data.)

    The specification recommends limiting the number of objects in

    For non-hybrid files, the value following

   </para>
   <para>
    For hybrid files (files containing both xref tables and
    cross-reference streams), the xref table's trailer dictionary
    contains the key <literal>/XRefStm</literal> whose value is the
    byte offset to a cross-reference stream that supplements the xref
    table.  A PDF 1.5-compliant application should read the xref table
    first.  Then it should replace any object that it has already seen
    with any defined in the xref stream.  Then it should follow any
    <literal>/Prev</literal> pointer in the original xref table's
    trailer dictionary.  The specification is not clear about what
    should be done, if anything, with a <literal>/Prev</literal>
    pointer in the xref stream referenced by an xref table.  The
    <classname>QPDF</classname> class ignores it, which is probably
    reasonable since, if this case were to appear for any sensible PDF
    file, the previous xref table would probably have a corresponding
    <literal>/XRefStm</literal> pointer of its own.  For example, if a
    hybrid file were appended, the appended section would have its own
    xref table and <literal>/XRefStm</literal>.  The appended xref
    table would point to the previous xref table which would point the

    There are three modes for writing object streams:
    <option>disable</option>, <option>preserve</option>, and
    <option>generate</option>.  In disable mode, we do not generate
    any object streams, and we also generate an xref table rather than
    xref streams.  This can be used to generate PDF files that are
    viewable with older readers.  In preserve mode, we write object
    streams such that written object streams contain the same objects
    and <literal>/Extends</literal> relationships as in the original
    file.  This is equal to disable if the file has no object streams.
    In generate, we create object streams ourselves by grouping
    objects that are allowed in object streams together in sets of no
    more than 100 objects.  We also ensure that the PDF version is at
    least 1.5 in generate mode, but we preserve the version header in
    the other modes.  The default is <option>preserve</option>.

          The code for handling form fields when copying pages from
          10.2.0 was not quite right and didn't work in a number of
          situations, such as when the same page was copied multiple
          times or when there were conflicting resource or field names
          across multiple copies. The 10.3.0 code has been much more
          thoroughly tested with more complex cases and with a
          multitude of readers and should be much closer to correct.
          The 10.2.0 code worked well enough for page splitting or for
          copying pages with form fields into documents that didn't
          already have them but was still not quite correct in
          handling of field-level resources.

          Reworked the code that handles copying annotations and form
          fields during page operations. There were additional methods
          added to the public API from 10.2.0 and a one deprecation of
          a method added in 10.2.0. The majority of the API changes
          are in methods most people would never call and that will
          hopefully be superseded by higher-level interfaces for

          Operations that work on combining pages are much better
          about protecting form fields. In particular,
          <option>--split-pages</option> and <option>--pages</option>
          now preserve interaction form functionality by copying the
          relevant form field information from the original files.
          Additionally, if you use <option>--pages</option> to select
          only some pages from the original input file, unused form
          fields are removed, which prevents lots of unused
          annotations from being retained.

          By default, <command>qpdf</command> no longer allows
          creation of encrypted PDF files whose user password is
          non-empty and owner password is empty when a 256-bit key is
          in use. The <option>--allow-insecure</option> option,
          specified inside the <option>--encrypt</option> options,
          allows creation of such files. Behavior changes in the CLI
          are avoided when possible, but an exception was made here
          because this is security-related. qpdf must always allow
          creation of weird files for testing purposes, but it should
          not default to letting users unknowingly create insecure
          files.

          Note: the changes in this section cause differences in
          output in some cases. These differences change the syntax of
          the PDF but do not change the semantics (meaning). I make a
          strong effort to avoid gratuitous changes in qpdf's output
          so that qpdf changes don't break people's tests. In this
          case, the changes significantly improve the readability of
          the generated PDF and don't affect any output that's
          generated by simple transformation. If you are annoyed by
          having to update test files, please rest assured that
          changes like this have been and will continue to be rare
          events.

          Page splitting and merging operations, as well as

          with respect to annotations and interactive form fields. In

          formatting and functionality of annotations is preserved by
          these operations. There are still some cases that aren't
          perfect, such as when functionality of annotations depends
          on document-level data that qpdf doesn't yet understand or
          when there are problems with referential integrity among
          form fields and annotations (e.g., when a single form field
          object or its associated annotations are shared across
          multiple pages, a case that is out of spec but that works in
          most viewers anyway).

	  If a form XObject lacks a resources dictionary, consider any
	  names in that form XObject to be referenced from the
	  containing page. This is compliant with older PDF versions.
	  Also detect if any form XObjects have any unresolved names
	  and, if so, don't remove unreferenced resources from them or
	  from the page that contains them. Unfortunately this has the
	  side effect of preventing removal of unreferenced resources
	  in some cases where names appear that don't refer to
	  resources, such as with tagged PDF. This is a bit of a
	  corner case that is not likely to cause a significant
	  problem in practice, but the only side effect would be lack
	  of removal of shared resources. A future version of qpdf may
	  be more sophisticated in its detection of names that refer
	  to resources.

          Thanks to Dean Scarff for this contribution. If you maintain
          qpdf for a distribution, pay special attention to make sure
          that you are including support for the crypto providers you
          want. Package maintainers will have to weigh the advantages
          of allowing users to pick a crypto provider at runtime
          against the disadvantages of adding more dependencies to
          qpdf.

          evident in other ways or that seem useful for some other
          reason. In this version, information is provided about each
          object indicating whether it is a stream and, if so, what
          its length and filters are. Without this, it was not
          possible to tell conclusively from the JSON output alone
          whether or not an object was a stream. Run <command>qpdf

          a fast heuristic over a PDF file when splitting pages to
          determine whether the expensive process of finding and
          removing unreferenced resources is likely to be of benefit.
          For most files, this new default will result in a
          significant performance improvement for splitting pages. See

          Random number generation is now delegated to the crypto
          provider. The old behavior is still used by the native
          crypto provider. It is still possible to provide your own
          random number generator.

          Add a new version of

          that accepts the <function>suppress_warnings</function> and
          <function>will_retry</function> options and allows a success
          code to be returned. This makes it possible to implement a

          <function>pipeStreamData</function> on another stream and to
          pass the response back to the caller, which enables better

          The

          method now allows separate control over whether it should be
          willing to shrink or expand objects to fit them better into
          the destination rectangle. The previous behavior was that
          shrinking was allowed but expansion was not. The previous
          behavior is still the default.

          On platforms that support it, qpdf now builds with
          <option>-fvisibility=hidden</option>. If you build qpdf with
          your own build system, this is now safe to use. This
          prevents methods that are not part of the public API from
          being exported by the shared library, and makes qpdf's ELF
          shared libraries (used on Linux, MacOS, and most other UNIX
          flavors) behave more like the Windows DLL. Since the DLL
          already behaves in much this way, it is unlikely that there
          are any methods that were accidentally not exported.
          However, with ELF shared libraries, typeinfo for some
          classes has to be explicitly exported. If there are problems
          in dynamically linked code catching exceptions or
          subclassing, this could be the reason. If you see this,
          please report a bug at <ulink

          <emphasis>Non-compatible CLI change:</emphasis> The qpdf
          command-line tool interprets passwords given at the
          command-line differently from previous releases when the
          passwords contain non-ASCII characters. In some cases, the
          behavior differs from previous releases. For a discussion of
          the current behavior, please see <xref
          linkend="ref.unicode-passwords"/>. The incompatibilities are

             On Windows, qpdf now receives all command-line options as
             Unicode strings if it can figure out the appropriate
             compile/link options. This is enabled at least for MSVC
             and mingw builds. That means that if non-ASCII strings
             are passed to the qpdf CLI in Windows, qpdf will now
             correctly receive them. In the past, they would have
             either been encoded as Windows code page 1252 (also known
             as &ldquo;Windows ANSI&rdquo; or as something
             unintelligible. In almost all cases, qpdf is able to
             properly interpret Unicode arguments now, whereas in the
             past, it would almost never interpret them properly. The
             result is that non-ASCII passwords given to the qpdf CLI
             on Windows now have a much greater chance of creating PDF
             files that can be opened by a variety of readers. In the
             past, usually files encrypted from the Windows CLI using
             non-ASCII passwords would not be readable by most
             viewers. Note that the current version of qpdf is able to
             decrypt files that it previously created using the
             previously supplied password.

            <para>
             The PDF specification requires passwords to be encoded as
             UTF-8 for 256-bit encryption and with PDF Doc encoding
             for 40-bit or 128-bit encryption. Older versions of qpdf
             left it up to the user to provide passwords with the
             correct encoding. The qpdf CLI now detects when a
             password is given with UTF-8 encoding and automatically
             transcodes it to what the PDF spec requires. While this
             is almost always the correct behavior, it is possible to
             override the behavior if there is some reason to do so.

          When opening an encrypted file with a password, if the

          <emphasis>Potential data-loss bug:</emphasis> Versions of
          qpdf between 8.1.0 and 8.3.0 had a bug that could cause page
          splitting and merging operations to drop some font or image
          resources if the PDF file's internal structure shared these
          resource lists across pages and if some but not all of the
          pages in the output did not reference all the fonts and
          images. Using the
          <option>--preserve-unreferenced-resources</option> option
          would work around the incorrect behavior. This bug was the
          result of a typo in the code and a deficiency in the test
          suite. The case that triggered the error was known, just not
          handled properly. This case is now exercised in qpdf's test
          suite and properly handled.

          When splitting files, qpdf detects fonts and images that the
          document metadata claims are referenced from a page but are
          not actually referenced and omits them from the output file.
          This change can cause a significant reduction in the size of
          split PDF files for files created by some software packages.
          In some cases, it can also make page splitting slower. Prior
          versions of qpdf would believe the document metadata and
          sometimes include all the images from all the other pages
          even though the pages were no longer present. In the
          unlikely event that the old behavior should be desired, or
          if you have a case where page splitting is very slow, the
          old behavior (and speed) can be enabled by specifying
          <option>--preserve-unreferenced-resources</option>. For
          additional details, please see <xref

          When merging multiple PDF files, qpdf no longer leaves all

          without specifying a page range, the rotation will be

          Improvements to handling of objects in PDF files that are
          not of the expected type. In most cases, qpdf will be able
          to warn for such cases rather than fail with an exception.
          Previous versions of qpdf would sometimes fail with errors
          such as &ldquo;operation for dictionary object attempted on

        PDF files contain streams that may be compressed with various
        compression algorithms which, in some cases, may be enhanced
        by various predictor functions. Previously only the PNG up
        predictor was supported. In this version, all the PNG
        predictors as well as the TIFF predictor are supported. This
        increases the range of files that qpdf is able to handle.

          QPDF is much better at recovering from broken files. In most
          cases, qpdf will skip invalid objects and will preserve
          broken stream data by not attempting to filter broken
          streams. QPDF is now able to recover or at least not crash
          on dozens of broken test files I have received over the past
          few years.

        When available, operating system-specific secure random number
        generation is used for generating initialization vectors and
        other random values used during encryption or file creation.
        For the Windows build, this results in an added dependency on
        Microsoft's cryptography API.  To disable the OS-specific
        cryptography and use the old version, pass the
        <option>--enable-insecure-random</option> option to
        <command>./configure</command>.

        The <command>qpdf</command> command-line tool now issues a
        warning when <option>-accessibility=n</option> is specified
        for newer encryption versions stating that the option is
        ignored.  qpdf, per the spec, has always ignored this flag,
        but it previously did so silently.  This warning is issued
        only by the command-line tool, not by the library.  The
        library's handling of this flag is unchanged.

        Major enhancement: support has been added for newer encryption
        schemes supported by version X of Adobe Acrobat.  This
        includes use of 127-character passwords, 256-bit encryption
        keys, and the encryption scheme specified in ISO 32000-2, the
        PDF 2.0 specification.  This scheme can be chosen from the
        command line by specifying use of 256-bit keys.  qpdf also
        supports the deprecated encryption method used by Acrobat IX.
        This encryption style has known security weaknesses and should
        not be used in practice.  However, such files exist &ldquo;in
        the wild,&rdquo; so support for this scheme is still useful.
        New methods
        <function>QPDFWriter::setR6EncryptionParameters</function>
        (for the PDF 2.0 scheme) and
        <function>QPDFWriter::setR5EncryptionParameters</function>
        (for the deprecated scheme) have been added to enable these
        new encryption schemes.  Corresponding functions have been
        added to the C API as well.

        extension level rather than increasing the version.  This

        This release includes a small handful of non-compatible API
        changes.  While effort is made to avoid such changes, all the
        non-compatible API changes in this version were to parts of
        the API that would likely never be used outside the library
        itself.  In all cases, the altered methods or structures were
        parts of the <classname>QPDF</classname> that were public to
        enable them to be called from either
        <classname>QPDFWriter</classname> or were part of validation
        code that was over-zealous in reporting problems in parts of
        the file that would not ordinarily be referenced.  In no case
        did any of the removed methods do anything worse that falsely
        report error conditions in files that were broken in ways that
        didn't matter.  The following public parts of the
        <classname>QPDF</classname> class were changed in a
        non-compatible way:
        <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
          <para>
           Updated nested <classname>QPDF::EncryptionData</classname>
           class to add fields needed by the newer encryption formats,
           member variables changed to private so that future changes
           will not require breaking backward compatibility.

           Removed the method
           <function>flattenScalarReferences</function>.  This method
           was previously used prior to writing a new PDF file, but it
           has the undesired side effect of causing qpdf to read
           objects in the file that were not referenced.  Some
           otherwise files have unreferenced objects with errors in
           them, so this could cause qpdf to reject files that would
           be accepted by virtually all other PDF readers.  In fact,
           qpdf relied on only a very small part of what
           flattenScalarReferences did, so only this part has been
           preserved, and it is now done directly inside
           <classname>QPDFWriter</classname>.

           Removed the method <function>decodeStreams</function>.
           This method was used by the <option>--check</option> option
           of the <command>qpdf</command> command-line tool to force
           all streams in the file to be decoded, but it also suffered
           from the problem of opening otherwise unreferenced streams
           and thus could report false positive.  The
           <option>--check</option> option now causes qpdf to go
           through all the motions of writing a new file based on the
           original one, so it will always reference and check exactly
           those parts of a file that any ordinary viewer would check.

           Removed the method

           used by <classname>QPDFWriter</classname> to modify the
           original QPDF object by removing fields from the trailer
           dictionary that wouldn't apply to the newly written file.
           This functionality, though generally harmless, was a poor
           implementation and has been replaced by having QPDFWriter
           filter these out when copying the trailer rather than
           modifying the original QPDF object.  (Note that qpdf never
           modifies the original file itself.)

        and design of the new API for manipulating pages, and
        contributed code and ideas for many of the improvements made
        in version 3.0.  Without his work, this release would
        certainly not have happened as soon as it did, if at all.

        <emphasis>Non-compatible API change:</emphasis> The version of
        <function>QPDFObjectHandle::replaceStreamData</function> that
        uses a <classname>StreamDataProvider</classname> no longer
        requires (or accepts) a <varname>length</varname> parameter.
        See <xref linkend="ref.upgrading-to-3.0"/> for an explanation.
        While care is taken to avoid non-compatible API changes in
        general, an exception was made this time because the new
        interface offers an opportunity to significantly simplify
        calling code.

        Support has been added for large files.  The test suite
        verifies support for files larger than 4 gigabytes, and manual
        testing has verified support for files larger than 10
        gigabytes.  Large file support is available for both 32-bit
        and 64-bit platforms as long as the compiler and underlying
        platforms support it.

        Bug fix: when preserving existing encryption on encrypted

        On Windows, it is possible to build a DLL. Additionally, a

        Although qpdf does not presently support files that use
        PKI-based encryption, with the addition of AES and crypt
        filters, qpdf is now be able to open most encrypted files
        created with newer versions of Acrobat or other PDF creation
        software.  Note that I have not been able to get very many
        files encrypted in this way, so it's possible there could
        still be some cases that qpdf can't handle.  Please report

  <title>Upgrading from 2.0 to 2.1</title>
  <para>
   Although, as a general rule, we like to avoid introducing
   source-level incompatibilities in qpdf's interface, there were a
   few non-compatible changes made in this version.  A considerable
   amount of source code that uses qpdf will probably compile without
   any changes, but in some cases, you may have to update your code.
   The changes are enumerated here.  There are also some new
   interfaces; for those, please refer to the header files.

    <para>
     QPDF's exception handling mechanism now uses
     <classname>std::logic_error</classname> for internal errors and
     <classname>std::runtime_error</classname> for runtime errors in
     favor of the now removed <classname>QEXC</classname> classes used
     in previous versions.  The <classname>QEXC</classname> exception
     classes predated the addition of the
     <filename>&lt;stdexcept&gt;</filename> header file to the C++
     standard library.  Most of the exceptions thrown by the qpdf
     library itself are still of type <classname>QPDFExc</classname>
     which is now derived from
     <classname>std::runtime_error</classname>.  Programs that caught
     an instance of <classname>std::exception</classname> and
     displayed it by calling the <function>what()</function> method
     will not need to be changed.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The <classname>QPDFExc</classname> class now internally
     represents various fields of the error condition and provides
     interfaces for querying them.  Among the fields is a numeric
     error code that can help applications act differently on (a small
     number of) different error conditions.  See
     <filename>QPDFExc.hh</filename> for details.

     The nested <classname>QPDF::EncryptionData</classname> class's
     constructor takes an additional argument.  This class is
     primarily intended to be used by
     <classname>QPDFWriter</classname>.  There's not really anything
     useful an end-user application could do with it.  It probably
     shouldn't really be part of the public interface to begin with.
     Likewise, some of the methods for computing internal encryption
     dictionary parameters have changed to support
     <literal>/R=4</literal> encryption.

     are now two new methods:
     <function>QPDF::getPaddedUserPassword</function> and
     <function>QPDF::getTrimmedUserPassword</function>.  The first one
     does what the old <function>QPDF::getUserPassword</function>
     method used to do, which is to return the password with possible
     binary padding as specified by the PDF specification.  The second
     one returns a human-readable password string.

     The enumerated types that used to be nested in
     <classname>QPDFWriter</classname> have moved to top-level

     shared by both the C and C++ interfaces.

 <appendix id="ref.upgrading-to-3.0">
  <title>Upgrading to 3.0</title>
  <para>
   For the most part, the API for qpdf version 3.0 is backward
   compatible with versions 2.1 and later.  There are two exceptions:
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The method
      <function>QPDFObjectHandle::replaceStreamData</function> that
      uses a <classname>StreamDataProvider</classname> to provide the
      stream data no longer takes a <varname>length</varname>
      parameter.  While it would have been easy enough to keep the
      parameter for backward compatibility, in this case, the
      parameter was removed since this provides the user an
      opportunity to simplify the calling code.  This method was
      introduced in version 2.2.  At the time, the
      <varname>length</varname> parameter was required in order to
      ensure that calls to the stream data provider returned the same
      length for a specific stream every time they were invoked.  In
      particular, the linearization code depends on this.  Instead,
      qpdf 3.0 and newer check for that constraint explicitly.  The
      first time the stream data provider is called for a specific
      stream, the actual length is saved, and subsequent calls are
      required to return the same number of bytes.  This means the
      calling code no longer has to compute the length in advance,
      which can be a significant simplification.  If your code fails
      to compile because of the extra argument and you don't want to
      make other changes to your code, just omit the argument.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Many methods take <type>long long</type> instead of other
      integer types.  Most if not all existing code should compile
      fine with this change since such parameters had always
      previously been smaller types.  This change was required to
      support files larger than two gigabytes in size.

  <title>Upgrading to 4.0</title>
  <para>
   While version 4.0 includes a few non-compatible API changes, it is
   very unlikely that anyone's code would have used any of those parts
   of the API since they generally required information that would
   only be available inside the library.  In the unlikely event that
   you should run into trouble, please see the ChangeLog.  See also
   <xref linkend="ref.release-notes"/> for a complete list of the
   non-compatible API changes made in this version.
