ROUTINE DEVELOPMENT

Default:

./configure --enable-werror --disable-shared

Debugging:

./configure CFLAGS="-g" CXXFLAGS="-g" --enable-werror --disable-shared

Memory checks:

./configure CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -g" \
   CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -g" \
   LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" \
   --enable-werror --disable-shared


CODING RULES

* Avoid atoi. Use QUtil::string_to_int instead. It does
  overflow/underflow checking.

* Remember to avoid using `operator[]` with `std::string` or
  `std::vector`. Instead, use `at()`. See README-hardening.md for
  details.


RELEASE PREPARATION

* Each year, update copyright notices. Just do a case-insensitive
  search for copyright. Don't forget copyright in manual. Also update
  debian copyright in debian package. Last updated: 2018.

* Check all open issues in the sourceforge trackers and on github.

* Check `TODO` file to make sure all planned items for the release are
  done or retargeted.

* Run a spelling checker over the source code to catch errors in
  variable names, strings, and comments.

  ispell -p words **/*.hh **/*.cc manual/*

* If needed, run large file and image comparison tests. Configure
  options:

--enable-test-compare-images --with-large-file-test-path=/path

  For Windows, use a Windows style path, not an MSYS path for large files.

* Test with clang. Pass `CC=clang CXX=clang++` to `./configure`.

* Test build on a mac.

* Test with address sanitizer as described above.

* A small handful of additional files have been taken from autotools
  programs. These should probably be updated from time to time.

  * `config.guess`, `config.sub`, `ltmain.sh`, and the `m4` directory:
    these were created by running `libtoolize -c`. To update, run
    `libtoolize -f -c` or remove the files and rerun `libtoolize`.

  * Other files copied as indicated:
    ```
    cp /usr/share/automake-1.11/install-sh .
    cp /usr/share/automake-1.11/mkinstalldirs .
    ```

  The entire contents of the `m4` directory came from `libtool.m4`. If
  we had some additional local parts, we could also add those to the
  `m4` directory. In order for this to work, it is necessary to run
  `aclocal -I m4` before running `autoheader` and `autoconf`. The
  `autogen.sh` script handles this.

* If any interfaces were added or changed, check C API to see whether
  changes are appropriate there as well. If necessary, review the
  casting policy in the manual, and ensure that integer types are
  properly handled.

* Increment shared library version information as needed (`LT_*` in
  `configure.ac`)

* Test for binary compatibility:
  * Check out the last release
  * ./autogen.sh && ./configure --enable-werror && make -j$(nproc)
  * Check out the current version
  * ./autogen.sh && ./configure --enable-werror && make -j$(nproc) build_libqpdf
  * Checkout the last release
  * make check NO_REBUILD=1

* Make sure version numbers are consistent in the following locations:
  * configure.ac
  * libqpdf/QPDF.cc
  * manual/qpdf-manual.xml
  `make_dist` verifies this consistency.

* Update release notes in manual. Look at diffs and ChangeLog. Update
  release date in `manual/qpdf-manual.xml`. Remember to ensure that
  the entities at the top of the document are consistent with the
  release notes for both version and release date.

* Add a release entry to ChangeLog.


CREATING A RELEASE

* Create source release:

version=x.y.z
rm -rf /tmp/qpdf-$version
git archive --prefix=qpdf-$version/ HEAD . | (cd /tmp; tar xf -)
cd /tmp
./qpdf-$version/make_dist
gpg --detach-sign --armor qpdf-$version.tar.gz

  Move qpdf-$version.tar.gz and qpdf-$version.tar.gz.asc to the
  release archive area.

  For iterating on the release during testing, pass `--no-tests` to
  make_dist to skip the test suite.

* Generate a signed AppImage using the docker image in appimage.
  Arguments to the docker container are arguments to git clone. The
  build should be made off the exact commit that will be officially
  tagged as the release but built prior to tagging the release.
  Example:

cd appimage
docker build -t qpdfbuild .
rm -rf /tmp/build
mkdir -p /tmp/build
cp -rLp ~/.gnupg/. /tmp/build/.gnupg
docker run --privileged -ti --rm -v /tmp/build:/tmp/build qpdfbuild https://github.com/jberkenbilt/qpdf -b work

  Rename the AppImage in /tmp/build/qpdf/appimage/build
  qpdf-$version-x86_64.AppImage and move it to the release archive
  area.

* Create Windows binary releases. In Windows:
  * Extract the source distribution
  * From there, unzip the binary distribution of the external libraries
  * Open windows for 32-bit and 64-bit compilation environments that
    support msvc and mingw
  * Disable antivirus software. For bitdefender, open, select the "B"
    shield, and go to "View Features". Disable advanced threat defense
    and vulnerability scanning.
  * In each window simultaneously, run ./make_windows_releases
  * Copy the four resulting zip files into the release archive area
  * Re-enable anti-virus software

* Build and test the debian package

* Sign the releases. The release archive area should contain the
  Windows binaries, the AppImage, the source tarball, and the source
  tarball signature.

\rm -f *.{md5,sha1,sha512}
files=(*)
for i in md5 sha1 sha512; do
  ${i}sum $files >| qpdf-$version.$i
  gpg --clearsign --armor qpdf-$version.$i
  mv qpdf-$version.$i.asc qpdf-$version.$i
done

* When creating releases on github and sourceforge, remember to copy
  `README-what-to-download.md` separately onto the download area if
  needed.

* Create a github release after pushing the tag. `gcurl` is an alias
  that includes the auth token.

# Create release
url=$(gcurl -s -XPOST https://api.github.com/repos/qpdf/qpdf/releases -d'{"tag_name": "release-qpdf-'$version'", "name": "qpdf '$version'", "draft": true}' | jq -r '.url')

# Get upload url
upload_url=$(gcurl -s $url | jq -r '.upload_url' | sed -E -e 's/\{.*\}//')
echo $upload_url

# Upload all the files. You can add a label attribute too, which
# overrides the name.
for i in *; do
  mime=$(file -b --mime-type $i)
  gcurl -H "Content-Type: $mime" --data-binary @$i "$upload_url?name=$i"
done

If needed, go onto github and make any manual updates such as
indicating a pre-release, adding release notes, etc.

# Publish release
gcurl -XPOST $url -d'{"draft": false}'

* Upload files to sourceforge. Make the source package the default for
  all but Windows, and make the 32-bit mingw build the default for
  Windows. Publish a news item manually on sourceforge.

* Update the web page to indicate the new version and to put the new
  documentation in the `files` subdirectory of the website on
  sourceforge.net.

* Email the qpdf-announce list.


OTHER NOTES

To construct a source distribution from a pristine checkout,
`make_dist` does the following:

./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-doc-maintenance --enable-werror
make build_manual
make distclean

To create a source release of external libs, do an export from the
version control system into a directory called `qpdf-external-libs`
and just make a zip file of the result called
`qpdf-external-libs-src.zip`. See the README.txt file there for
information on creating binary external libs releases. Run this from
the external-libs repository:

git archive --prefix=external-libs/ HEAD . | (cd /tmp; tar xf -)
cd /tmp
zip -r qpdf-external-libs-src.zip external-libs

When releasing on sourceforge, `external-libs` distributions go in
`external-libs/yyyymmdd`, and qpdf distributions go in `qpdf/vvv`.


GENERAL BUILD STUFF

QPDF uses autoconf and libtool but does not use automake. The only
files distributed with the qpdf source distribution that are not
controlled are `configure`, `libqpdf/qpdf/qpdf-config.h.in`,
`aclocal.m4`, and some documentation. See above for the steps required
to prepare a source distribution.

If building or editing documentation, configure with
`--enable-doc-maintenance`. This will ensure that all tools or files
required to validate and build documentation are available.

If you want to run `make maintainer-clean`, `make distclean`, or `make
autofiles.zip` and you haven't run `./configure`, you can pass
`CLEAN=1` to make on the command line to prevent it from complaining
about configure not having been run.

If you want to run checks without rerunning the build, pass
`NO_REBUILD=1` to make. This can be useful for special testing
scenarios such as validation of memory fixes or binary compatibility.


LOCAL WINDOWS TESTING PROCEDURE

This is what I do for routine testing on Windows.

From Linux, run `./autogen.sh` and `make autofiles.zip CLEAN=1`.

From Windows, git clone from my Linux clone, unzip `external-libs`,
and unzip `autofiles.zip`.

Look at `make_windows_releases`. Set up path the same way and run
whichever `./config-*` is appropriate for whichever compiler I need to
test with. Start one of the Visual Studio native compiler shells, and
from there, run one of the msys shells. The Visual Studio step is not
necessary if just building with mingw.
