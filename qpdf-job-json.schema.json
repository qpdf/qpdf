If multiple page label specs are specified, they must be given in increasing order.\n If multiple page label specs are specified, they must be given in increasing order.\n A given page label spec causes pages to be numbered according to that scheme starting with first-page and continuing until the next label spec or the end of the document. If you want to omit numbering starting at a certain page, you can use first-page: as the spec.\n Example: \"1:r 5:D\" would number the first four pages i through iv, then the remaining pages with Arabic numerals starting with 1 and continuing sequentially until the end of the document.
