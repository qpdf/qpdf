40-bit encryption is insecure, as is 128-bit encryption without
AES. Use 256-bit encryption unless you have a specific reason to
use an insecure format, such as testing or compatibility with very
old viewers. You must use the --allow-weak-crypto to create
encrypted files that use insecure cryptographic algorithms. The
--allow-weak-crypto flag appears outside of --encrypt ... --
(before --encrypt or after --).

Available options vary by key length. Not all readers respect all
restrictions. Different PDF readers respond differently to various
combinations of options. Sometimes a PDF viewer may show you
restrictions that differ from what you selected. This is probably
not a bug in qpdf.

For 128-bit only:
  --use-aes=[y|n]          indicates whether to use AES encryption
  --force-V4               forces use of V=4 encryption handler

For 256-bit only:
