// This pipeline applies or reverses the application of a PNG filter
// as described in the PNG specification.

// NOTE: In its initial implementation, it only encodes and decodes
// filters "none" and "up".  The primary motivation of this code is to
// encode and decode PDF 1.5+ XRef streams which are often encoded
// with Flate predictor 12, which corresponds to the PNG up filter.
// At present, the bytes_per_pixel parameter is ignored, and an
// exception is thrown if any row of the file has a filter of other
// than 0 or 2.  Finishing the implementation would not be difficult.
// See chapter 6 of the PNG specification for a description of the
// filter algorithms.
