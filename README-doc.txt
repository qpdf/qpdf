WHERE TO FIND THE QPDF DOCUMENTATION

Complete documentation for qpdf can be found online here:
https://qpdf.readthedocs.io

Some distributions include offline documentation typically in a
location such as /usr/share/doc/qpdf. If it isn't there, you can find
a zip file containing the documentation in the qpdf release area:
https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf/releases

Offline documentation contains the following:

* PDF: qpdf-manual.pdf
* HTML: manual-html/index.html
* SINGLE-PAGE HTML: manual-single-page-html/index.html

If you are reading this file from the source distribution, you can
find the documentation sources in the "manual" directory. There is
information in the manual about how to build and package the
documentation.
