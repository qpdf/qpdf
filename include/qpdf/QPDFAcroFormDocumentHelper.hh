#ifndef QPDFACROFORMDOCUMENTHELPER_HH

// This document helper is intended to help with operations on
// interactive forms. Here are the key things to know:

// * The PDF specification talks about interactive forms and also
//   about form XObjects. While form XObjects appear in parts of
//   interactive forms, this class is concerned about interactive
//   forms, not form XObjects.
//
// * Interactive forms are discussed in the PDF Specification (ISO PDF
//   32000-1:2008) section 12.7. Also relevant is the section about
//   Widget annotations. Annotations are discussed in section 12.5
//   with annotation dictionaries discussed in 12.5.1. Widget
//   annotations are discussed specifically in section 12.5.6.19.
//
// * What you need to know about the structure of interactive forms in
//   PDF files:
//
//   - The document catalog contains the key "/AcroForm" which
//     contains a list of fields. Fields are represented as a tree
//     structure much like pages. Nodes in the fields tree may contain
//     other fields. Fields may inherit values of many of their
//     attributes from ancestors in the tree.
//
//   - Fields may also have children that are widget annotations. As a
//     special case, and a cause of considerable confusion, if a field
//     has a single annotation as a child, the annotation dictionary
//     may be merged with the field dictionary. In that case, the
//     field and the annotation are in the same object. Note that,
//     while field dictionary attributes are inherited, annotation
//     dictionary attributes are not.
//
//   - A page dictionary contains a key called "/Annots" which
//     contains a simple list of annotations. For any given annotation
//     of subtype "/Widget", you should encounter that annotation in
//     the "/Annots" dictionary of a page, and you should also be able
//     to reach it by traversing through the "/AcroForm" dictionary
//     from the document catalog. In the simplest case (and also a
//     very common case), a form field's widget annotation will be
//     merged with the field object, and the object will appear
//     directly both under "/Annots" in the page dictionary and under
//     "/Fields" in the "/AcroForm" dictionary. In a more complex
//     case, you may have to trace through various "/Kids" elements in
//     the "/AcroForm" field entry until you find the annotation
//     dictionary.
