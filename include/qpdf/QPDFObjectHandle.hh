        // QPDFWriter may, in some cases, add compression, but if it
        // does, it will update the filters as needed. Every call to
        // provideStreamData for a given stream must write the same
        // data. Note that, when writing linearized files, qpdf will
        // call your provideStreamData twice, and if it generates
        // different output, you risk generating invalid output or
        // having qpdf throw an exception. The object ID and
        // generation passed to this method are those that belong to
        // the stream on behalf of which the provider is called. They
        // may be ignored or used by the implementation for indexing
        // or other purposes. This information is made available just
        // to make it more convenient to use a single
        // StreamDataProvider object to provide data for multiple
        // streams.

        // A few things to keep in mind:
        //
        // * Stream data providers must not modify any objects since
        //   they may be called after some parts of the file have
        //   already been written.
        //
        // * Since qpdf may call provideStreamData multiple times when
        //   writing linearized files, if the work done by your stream
        //   data provider is slow or computationally intensive, you
        //   might want to implement your own cache.
        //
        // * Once you have called replaceStreamData, the original
        //   stream data is no longer directly accessible from the
        //   stream, but this is easy to work around by copying the
        //   stream to a separate QPDF object. The qpdf library
        //   implements this very efficiently without actually making
        //   a copy of the stream data. You can find examples of this
        //   pattern in some of the examples, including
        //   pdf-custom-filter.cc and pdf-invert-images.cc.

        // Prior to qpdf 10.0.0, it was not possible to handle errors
        // the way pipeStreamData does or to pass back success.
        // Starting in qpdf 10.0.0, those capabilities have been added
        // by allowing an alternative provideStreamData to be
        // implemented. You must implement at least one of the
        // versions of provideStreamData below. If you implement the
        // version that supports retry and returns a value, you should
        // pass true as the value of supports_retry in the base class
        // constructor. This will cause the library to call that

    // You may also use Pl_QPDFTokenizer directly if you need full

    // The handleToken method is called for each token, including the

    // downstream. Please see examples/pdf-filter-tokens.cc and
    // examples/pdf-count-strings.cc for examples of using
    // TokenFilters.
    //
    // Please note that when you call token.getValue() on a token of
    // type tt_string or tt_name, you get the canonical, "parsed"
    // representation of the token. For a string, this means that
    // there are no delimiters, and for a name, it means that all

    // directly to output that is supposed to be valid PDF syntax. If
    // you want to do that, you need to call writeToken() instead, or
    // you can retrieve the token as it appeared in the input with

    // QPDFTokenizer::Token(QPDFTokenizer::tt_name,
    // "/Canonical-Name"). Tokens created this way won't have a
    // PDF-syntax raw value, but you can still write them with
    // writeToken(). Example:
    // writeToken(QPDFTokenizer::Token(QPDFTokenizer::tt_name, "/text/plain"))

    // In PDF files, objects have specific types, but there is nothing
    // that prevents PDF files from containing objects of types that
    // aren't expected by the specification.
    //
    // There are two flavors of accessor methods:
    //
    // * getSomethingValue() returns the value and issues a type
    //   warning if the type is incorrect.
    //
    // * getValueAsSomething() returns false if the value is the wrong
    //   type. Otherwise, it returns true and initializes a reference
    //   of the appropriate type. These methods never issue type
    //   warnings.
    //
    // The getSomethingValue() accessors and some of the other methods
    // expect objects of a particular type. Prior to qpdf 8, calling
    // an accessor on a method of the wrong type, such as trying to
    // get a dictionary key from an array, trying to get the string
    // value of a number, etc., would throw an exception, but since
    // qpdf 8, qpdf issues a warning and recovers using the following
    // behavior:
    //
    // * Requesting a value of the wrong type (int value from string,
    //   array item from a scalar or dictionary, etc.) will return a
    //   zero-like value for that type: false for boolean, 0 for
    //   number, the empty string for string, or the null object for
    //   an object handle.
    //
    // * Accessing an array item that is out of bounds will return a
    //   null object.
    //
    // * Attempts to mutate an object of the wrong type (e.g.,
    //   attempting to add a dictionary key to a scalar or array) will
    //   be ignored.
    //
    // When any of these fallback behaviors are used, qpdf issues a
    // warning. Starting in qpdf 10.5, these warnings have the error
    // code qpdf_e_object. Prior to 10.5, they had the error code
    // qpdf_e_damaged_pdf. If the QPDFObjectHandle is associated with
    // a QPDF object (as is the case for all objects whose origin was
    // a PDF file), the warning is issued using the normal warning
    // mechanism (as described in QPDF.hh), making it possible to
    // suppress or otherwise detect them. If the QPDFObjectHandle is
    // not associated with a QPDF object (meaning it was created
    // programmatically), an exception will be thrown.
    //
    // The way to avoid getting any type warnings or exceptions, even
    // when working with malformed PDF files, is to always check the
    // type of a QPDFObjectHandle before accessing it (for example,
    // make sure that isString() returns true before calling
    // getStringValue()) and to always be sure that any array indices
    // are in bounds.
