// Generalized Pipeline interface.  By convention, subclasses of
// Pipeline are called Pl_Something.
//
// When an instance of Pipeline is created with a pointer to a next
// pipeline, that pipeline writes its data to the next one when it
// finishes with it.  In order to make possible a usage style in which
// a pipeline may be passed to a function which may stick other
// pipelines in front of it, the allocator of a pipeline is
// responsible for its destruction.  In other words, one pipeline
// object does not attempt to manage the memory of its successor.
//
// The client is required to call finish() before destroying a
// Pipeline in order to avoid loss of data.  A Pipeline class should
// not throw an exception in the destructor if this hasn't been done
// though since doing so causes too much trouble when deleting
// pipelines during error conditions.
//
// Some pipelines are reusable (i.e., you can call write() after
// calling finish() and can call finish() multiple times) while others
// are not.  It is up to the caller to use a pipeline according to its
// own restrictions.
